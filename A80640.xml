            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Otherwiſe (as this book bears notable witnes) our eyes and ears shal be abuſed, and our judgements warped from the ſimplicity and ſtraitneſſe of Truth. Suppoſe any real difference should be between us: if we agree in <hi>founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doctrinals,</hi> yea, and in the main Principles of the <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution</hi> and <hi>jurisdiction,</hi> or power of a <hi>particular Congregation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Church:</hi> as that it should conſiſt of <hi>Saints in union,</hi> inveſted with <hi>Power</hi> to take in and caſt out; I wonder it should amount to ſo high a conteſt, about degrees (which alter not the kind) of <hi>forming</hi> and <hi>reforming</hi> ſuch a Church. <hi>You</hi> ſay SAINTS in <hi>outward profeſsion</hi> is <hi>the Matter</hi> of ſuch a Church; and an implicit uniting, <hi>viz.</hi> a walking and communicating with you is a ſufficient <hi>evidencing of the form. We</hi> judge that <hi>real</hi> SAINTS uttering in diſcourſe the breathings of the Holy Spirit, and experiences of converſion, witneſſed in a ſtricter converſation, to be the <hi>Matter;</hi> and their <hi>ſolemn confeſsion</hi> of their Faith, and <hi>expreſſe open covenanting</hi> with the Lord to walk with ſuch a body of Saints in all the wayes of Chriſt to their light and power for reciprocal edification, to be the <hi>Manifest Form.</hi> How is it now that only <hi>a going before one another in degrees of reformation, according to the National ſolemn League and Covenant,</hi> should breed in you as it were a <hi>ſpecifical</hi> oppoſition againſt us?

If <hi>we</hi> need adviſe, we shal wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly look on a company of Godly Elder and Brethren of other
<pb facs="tcp:124282:4"/> Churches, called together for counſel by our, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Churches (be the Aſſembly of them ſmaller, greater, or greateſt) as upon an Ordinance of Chriſt, and as bound by the Truth of Chriſt as readily to receive, as they are to give counſel to us according to the Truth.

And if a Perſwaſive to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem</hi> were a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing; then a Diſſwaſive from the Errors of the Time (rightly ſo called) is a bleſſing alſo. But when Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> is pleaſed amongſt the Errors of the time to reckon (that which he calleth) Independency; he may do well to conſider, whether he bring not upon his credulous Reader a curſe in ſtead of a bleſſing.</p>
               <p>The ſuppoſed Errors found in thoſe who are called Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Churches, are chiefly two, upon which all the reſt doe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend: and both of them ſuch as may well be cleared by <hi>Noah</hi>'s bleſſing.</p>

                  </gap> had been a curſe both to them and <hi>Shem</hi> (if he had ſo prayed) and not a bleſſing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. They hold alſo, that <hi>Japhet</hi> himſelf ſhould not be brought to dwell in the Tents of <hi>Shem</hi> till God perſwade him. They
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:124282:8"/> would not have <hi>Shem</hi> to enlarge his Tents, to compaſſe or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell <hi>Japhet</hi> to live under his ſhadow. It is one thing for <hi>Japhet</hi> and <hi>Shem</hi> to dwell together by voluntary conſociation; another thing for <hi>Shem</hi> to rule over <hi>Japhet</hi> by undeſired and unallowed juriſdiction. Let <hi>Cham</hi> and <hi>Chanaan</hi> be as ſervants unto <hi>Shem</hi> and to <hi>Japhet</hi> too, (for ſo <hi>Noah</hi> prophecyed:) but let not <hi>Japhet</hi> be a ſervant to <hi>Shem,</hi> no more then <hi>Shem</hi> to <hi>Japhet.</hi> But though theſe bee the principall Tenents of Independents (as they are called;) and indeed bleſſed truths in the bleſſing of <hi>Noah:</hi> yet Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> reckoneth theſe amongſt the Errors of the Times; and the Independents themſelves amongſt the wanderers on the right hand, together with Browniſts, (as he calleth them,) Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts, Antinomians, Seekers: As on the left hand, he recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth Prelates, Papiſts, Arminians, Socinians, Eraſtians.

                  <p>MAſter <hi>Baylie</hi> rightly obſerveth, <q rend="margQuotes">That in our departure &amp; flight from <hi>Rome,</hi> ſome took up their ſtand too ſoon, before they had paſſed the lines (he meaneth all the lines) of communication with the Whore: and others ran on too long (or too far) beyond the bounds of truth and love.</q> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer of theſe ſorts he maketh the Lutherans, in reſpect of ſome defects in their Reformation. The latter, he maketh to be the Anabaptiſts in <hi>Germany.</hi> The ſucceſſors of the former, he maketh

                     </gap>s of the latter ſort, (the Anabaptiſts) he maketh to be thoſe whom he ſtyleth Browniſts.</p>
                  <p>But as there is a vaſt difference between the Epiſcopacy of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and the Superintendency of <hi>Germany,</hi> (the one ruling by Monarchicall Power, the other by the conſent of the Ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Presbytery:) ſo neither is there ſuch correſpondency be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Germane</hi> Anabaptiſm, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Browniſm, as to make Browniſm a native branch of Anabaptiſm.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">Yes, (ſaith the Diſſwader) That Browniſm is a native branch of Anabaptiſm, is evidenced, by the frequent tranſition of the one to the other. The diſſolution of ice and ſnow into water, argueth ſtrongly their originall from that element; ſo the ordinary running over of the Separatiſts to the Anabaptiſts.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The diſſolution of ice and ſnow into water, doth indeed argue ſtrongly their originall from water, becauſe they are eaſily reſolved into it without putrefaction or corruption. But ſo i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> not the Separatiſt reſolved into a <hi>German</hi> Anabaptiſt, without a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther degree of corruption and putrefaction. It is no argument a man is bred of worms, becauſe he is next reſolved into worms; for he is not ſo reſolved without putrefaction. Say not, a man is reſolved at laſt into duſt from whence he was firſt taken; and yet the reſolution is not made without putrefaction. For a man is not made of duſt naturally, but by a tranſcendent creating power above Nature. But the Diſſwader maketh the Separation a native branch of Anabaptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, I ſuppoſe, it is not an obvious thing to hear of an Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſt turn Separatiſt, though ſome Separatiſts have turned Ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baptiſts; which argueth there is not ſuch a mutuall frequent tranſition from the one to the other, as is yearly found of ice and ſnow into water, and of water into ice or ſnow again.</p>

                  <p>The firſt Separatiſt, which the Diſſwader ſaith he hath read of, <q rend="margQuotes">was one <hi>Bolton,</hi> who was a Miniſter of an old ſeparate Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, and afterwards felt the ſenſe of his Errors ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to his ſoul, (by the finger of Gods Juſtice ſtirring in his

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though <hi>Bolton</hi> may have been the firſt Separatiſt that the Diſſwader hath read of; yet he might have read of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers before him. For in the Book called The Regiſter of memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable matters touching Reformation, there is recorded a ſtory of an hundred perſons, who refuſed the common Liturgie, and the Congregations attending thereunto, and uſed prayers and prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chings, and Sacraments amongſt themſelves: whereof 14 or 15 were ſent to priſon: Of whom the chiefeſt was Mr. <hi>Smith,</hi> with Mr. <hi>Nixon, James Ireland, Robert Hawkins, Thomas Boweland,</hi> and <hi>Richard Morecroft.</hi> And theſe pleaded their ſeparation before the Lord Mayor, Biſhop <hi>Sands,</hi> and other Commiſſioners on June 20. in the year 1567. which is about fourſcore years agoe; and this as it ſeemeth was many years before <hi>Bolton;</hi> for Mr. <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> reckoneth the wandring of the Separatiſts to be about 50 years ſtanding, (<hi>page</hi> 59.) but this <hi>Smith</hi> and his company was 30 years before.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Old Mr. <hi>Bruiſter</hi> (the reverend Elder of the Church of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> a man of long-approved piety, gravity, integrity) his teſtimony of this <hi>Bolton</hi> may take off the prejudice which the fearfull fall of <hi>Bolton</hi> ſeemeth to Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> to caſt upon the Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration: Which I will recite, not to juſtifie that way of his ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, but to take off unjuſt ſcandals. <q rend="margQuotes">This <hi>Bolton</hi> (ſaith he) partly by the terrors of Biſhops, and partly by flattery, was brought indeed to recant. But afterwards they ſleighting him, the terrors of the Almighty fell upon him, and conſidering how he had ſinned againſt his conſcience, he (<hi>Judas</hi>-like) laid violent hands upon himſelf.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Diſſwader may be pleaſed to conſider, that Apoſtaſie from the way of Separation, and terror of conſcience even to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation, and ſelf-murder following thereupon, are no juſt excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt Separation: no more than <hi>Judas</hi> his apoſtaſie from Chriſt, and terror of conſcience even to deſperation and ſelf-hanging following thereupon, were any juſt exceptions againſt Chriſtianity.</p>

                  <p>Of Mr. <hi>Brown</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> it is farre from me to make any defence either of their perſons, or of their way of rigid Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the hand of God upon their ſpirit, giving them up, one to a ſpirit of inconſtancy and prophaneneſſe; the other to a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of bitterneſſe and raſhneſſe. Though it is no juſt conviction of the errors of their way of Separation: yet it is a ſhrewd argument that either their way was not right, or their hearts not upright in it.</p>
                  <p>But this let me ſay, be it ſo, that <hi>Brown</hi> did revolt from his way, and took a Parſonage from the Biſhop, and that in a Town by name called <hi>A-church</hi> in <hi>Northampton-ſhire,</hi> (a reall check to his error, who formerly counted every Church in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> no Church:) yet this back ſliding of <hi>Brown</hi> from that way of Separation, is a juſt reaſon why the Separatiſts may diſclaim denomination from him, and refuſe to be called after his name, Browniſts. If <hi>Judas,</hi> or <hi>Julian,</hi> or <hi>Ecebolius</hi> doe apoſtate from Chriſtianity, no reaſon is there that all that profeſſe the way of Chriſtianity ſhould be called Judaites, or Julianiſts, or Ecebo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lians. In the Eccleſiaſticall Hiſtory, though <hi>Photinus</hi> was the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple of <hi>Marcellus</hi> in an hereticall opinion touching Chriſt: yet the followers of them both, when <hi>Marcellus</hi> had revoked his error, were not called <hi>Marcellini</hi> but <hi>Photiniani.</hi> To ſpeak with reaſon, if any be juſtly to be called Browniſts, it is onely ſuch as revolt from Separation to Formality, and from thence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſſe. For Mr. <hi>Barrow,</hi> though I neither excuſe the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoundneſſe of his judgment, nor the bitterneſſe of his ſtyle: yet I doubt the Diſſwader is deceived, when he ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">That Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was ſo impatient of his contumelies, that ſhe cauſed him in a morning to be hanged on the Tower-hill.</q> For there be grave Profeſſors (who lived nearer thoſe occurrences) who ſpeak of Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> as ignorant of <hi>Barrow</hi>'s execution, and <hi>Greenwood</hi>'s, and diſpleaſed at it, when ſhe heard of it afterwards: neither was their execution on Tower-hill, but at Tyburn, long after the ſentence of death paſſed againſt them.</p>

                  <p>The Diſſwader is deceived when he ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> with his half, did excommunicate Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> and his half.</q> For, as I am informed by ſome judicious Profeſſors who lived in thoſe parts, Mr. <hi>Ainſworth</hi> and his company did not excommunicate Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> and his, but onely withdrew from them, when they could no longer live peaceably with them. Mr. <hi>Johnſon</hi> his laſt Book, argueth he had learned more moderation of ſpirit, then he did put forth in his former times.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Ainſworth,</hi> a man of a more modeſt and humble ſpirit, and diligently ſtudious of the Hebrew Text, hath not beene un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſefull to the Church in his Expoſition of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Rituals, notwithſtanding ſome uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed, and ungrounded Rabbinicall obſervations recited, but not refuted.</p>
                  <p>But when the Diſſawder ſaith, that M. <hi>Ainſworths</hi> company after <q rend="margQuotes">his death, remained long without all Officers;</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>There bee ſundry living that know the contrary. For when he dyed he left two Elders over the Church, Mr. <hi>Delacluſe,</hi> and Mr. <hi>May.</hi>

For though the tyranny of the Eccleſiaſticall Courts was harſh towards him, and the yokes put upon him in his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, too grievous to bee borne: yet neither was hee alone in ſuffering: Nor were thoſe that ſuffered with him at that time, (Mr. <hi>Clifton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi>) ſuch inconſiderable Perſons, that hee ſhould affect to goe alone from them. It is true, he had found helpe by the conference (which himſelf had requeſted) with Mr. <hi>Dod,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilderſon,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Barbon,</hi> before he left <hi>England:</hi> yea and ſuch helpe, that he thought he could have gained his Tutor <hi>Iohnſon,</hi> from the Errors of his Rigid Separation. But hee had promiſed them, not to goe over to him, without their conſents: and they utterly diſſwaded him there-from, as fearing his inſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility. And yet contrary to his Promiſe he went over to him, yea, and that contrary to his owne pretence and offer of another conference with them before his going. Though the way of Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gid Separation had been leſſe Heterodoxall, then it is, yet to venture upon it in ſuch breach of manifeſt Rules, no marvell, if it led him into manifeſt temptations and Abberations.</p>
                  <p>The Diſſwader is miſ-informed, when hee ſaith (page 16) <q rend="margQuotes"> he moved a great company to follow him to <hi>Ley</hi> in <hi>Holland.</hi>

                  <p>Of Mr. <hi>Robinſon,</hi> the Diſſwader doth rightly obſerve, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>As a fruit of his ſtudious inquiſition after the Truth, hee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted (as I have underſtood) to many judicious Divines in <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> for the clearing of his Scruples, which inclined him to ſeparation: and when hee came into <hi>Holland,</hi> hee addreſſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe to Doctor <hi>Ames,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Parker:</hi> rather preventing them with ſeeking counſell and ſatisfaction, then waiting for their compaſſion. But as they excelled in learning and godlineſſe, ſo in compaſſion and brotherly love alſo; and therefore as they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned his weanedneſſe from ſelfe-fulneſſe, ſo did they more
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:124282:11"/> freely communicate light to him, and received alſo ſomethings from him. The fruit of which was (through the Grace of Chriſt) that the Diſſwader himſelfe confeſſeth, <q rend="margQuotes">hee came backe indeed the one halfe of the way: Acknowledging the lawfulneſſe of communicating with the Church of <hi>England,</hi> in the Word and Prayer: but not in the Sacraments and Diſcipline, which was (ſaith hee) a faire Bridge, at leaſt a faire Arch of a Bridge for union.</q> But when he ſaith, hee came on to communicate with the Church of <hi>England</hi> in the Word and Prayer, it muſt not bee underſtood of the Common-Prayer-Book, but of the Prayers conceived by the Preacher before and after Sermon: And yet in comming on ſo far as he did, he came more then halfe way of any juſt diſtance.</p>
                  <p>For though hee ſtuck at the Common Liturgy, Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Diſcipline: yet ſince then it hath appeared, there was no juſt ground of comming on to them. The Honourable Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and Reverend Aſſembly of Divines have (by the grace of Chriſt) ſeen juſt cauſe to remove the Liturgy, to aboliſh the Hierarchy (which was the Diſcipline hee chiefly ſtuck at) and to give order for reſtraint of ignorant and ſcandalous Perſons from the Sacrament, which may well make up two or three Arches more (as Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> calleth it) of that faire bridge for union, farre more then the halfe way.</p>
                  <p>It is true, Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> did not acknowledge a Nationall Church governed by the Epiſcopacy to be a Church of Divine Inſtitution. But though hee acknowledged the ſtile and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges of a Church in the New Teſtament to belong to a parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Congregation of viſible Saints: yet ſuch Nationall Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches, French or Dutch, as were governed by Presbyters, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from the world at the Lords Table, he did not diſclaime Communion with them, I have beene given to underſtand, that when a Reverend and godly Scottiſh Miniſter came that way, (it ſeemeth to have been Mr. <hi>Iohn Tarbes</hi>) he offered him Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion at the Lords Table: though the other for feare of offence to the Scottiſh Churches at home, excuſed himſelfe.

                     <hi>SECT. VI.</hi> Of the contempt and contumelie ſaid to be put upon the old Browniſts by the Independents.</head>
                  <p>TO ſhut up this Chapter, the Diſſwader telleth us, <q rend="margQuotes">That the way of the old Browniſts is become contemptible not onely to all the reſt of the world, but to their own children alſo; even they begin to heap coals of contumelies upon their Parents heads; as may be ſeen in the Elogies which both Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and the five Apologiſts are pleaſed to give them in Print; yea, ſo much are theſe Children aſhamed of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, that they uſually take it for a contumelie to be called af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their name. No Independent will take it well at any mans hand to be called a Browniſt either in whole, or in the ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſt part.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. No marvail, if Independents take it ill to bee called Browniſts, in whole, or in part. For neither in whole, nor in part doe we partake in his Schiſm. He ſeparated from Churches and from Saints: we, onely from the world, and that which is of the world. He turned apoſtate from the Separation which he had profeſſed: and it is abſurd to denominate either Sect or right way, from ſuch as apoſtate from it. If he had ſtood conſtant in his way, and his way had been the ſame with ours, yet we were
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:124282:12"/> not baptized into his Name; and why ſhould we then be called after his Name? If ſchiſm be a manifeſt fruit of the fleſh, then they that give Nick-names tending to the reproach and diviſion of Brethren, they walk after the fleſh; for they ſow variance and ſchiſm amongſt Brethren.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is an unjuſt and unworthy calumny, to call either <hi>Cotton</hi> or the Apologers, the children of their Fathers, whom he ſtyleth Browniſts. They never begot us, either to God, or to the Church, or to their Schiſm: a Schiſm, which as we have lamented in them, (as a fruit of miſguided ignorant zeal:) ſo we have ever born witneſſe againſt it, ſince our firſt knowledg of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Though we put not ſuch Honor upon thoſe he calleth Browniſts, as to own them for our Fathers; yet neither doe we put ſo much diſhonor upon them, <q rend="margQuotes">as to heap coals of contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mely upon their heads.</q> We look not at them with contempt, but compaſſion: Neither doe we bear witneſſe againſt their Schiſm in any words of contempt and reproach, (which are the characters of contumelie) but in words of ſpirituall and juſt reproof; even in ſuch terms, not which ſcornfull wit, but which holy Scripture ſuggeſteth.</p>

                  <p>THe way of the Churches in <hi>New-England</hi> is neither juſtly called a Sect, nor fitly called Independency. Not a Sect; for we profeſſe the Orthodox Doctrine of Faith, the ſame with all Proteſtant Churches; we celebrate the ſame Sacraments; and ſubmit to the ſpirituall government of the ſame lawfull Guides, ſo farre as Chriſt and our own choyce hath ſet them over us. And though we doe not ſubject our ſelves to the Government of the Elders of other Churches, (as many great Churches doe,) yet we acknowledge and reverence ſuch Churches in the Lord, as
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:124282:12"/> true Churches of Chriſt, and are willing to make uſe of their Brotherly counſell and help as need ſhall require.</p>
                  <p>And though we doe not open the doors of our Churches ſo wide, as to receive all the Inhabitants of a Nation, or of every Town, into the fellowſhip of our Churches; yet we doe not ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate from ſuch Proteſtant Churches as doe take that liberty: but onely we ſeparate from the world, that is, from the worldly ſort of them, who either live in open ſcandall, or at leaſt doe not openly hold forth any ſpirituall diſcerning of the Lords Body, and are therefore u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>eet to communicate at the Lord Table.</p>
                  <p>Nor is Independency a fit name of the way of our Churches. For in ſome reſpects it is too ſtrait, and in others too large; it is too ſtrait, in that it confineth us within our ſelves, and holdeth us forth as Independent from all others: whereas indeed we doe profeſſe dependence upon Magiſtrates for civil Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and protection: Dependence upon Chriſt and his Word, for the ſoveraign government and rule of our adminiſtrations: Dependence upon the counſell of other Churches and Synods; when our own variance or ignorance may ſtand in need of ſuch help from them. And therefore this title of Independency ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth us, &amp; reſtraineth us from our neceſſary duty, and due liberty.</p>
                  <p>Again, in other reſpects, Independency ſtretcheth it ſelf too largely, and more generally, then that it can ſingle out us. For it is compatible to a Nationall Church, as well as to a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gationall. The Nationall Church of <hi>Scotland</hi> is Independent from the Government of the Nationall Church of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo is <hi>England</hi> Independent from <hi>Scotland.</hi> Nor is there any Sect at this day extant, but ſhrowdeth themſelves under the title of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependency. The Antipaedobaptiſts, Antinomians, Familiſts, yea, and the Seekers too, do all of them ſtyle themſelves Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. Nay, even the Pope himſelf, (who exalteth himſelf above all Civill and Church-power) yet even he alſo arrogateth the title of Independency; <hi>Prima ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But for the quality of the perſons, the Diſſwader telleth us, <q rend="margQuotes">They have been ſo wiſe, as to engage to their party ſome of chief note in both Houſes of Parliament, in the Aſſembly of Divines, in the Army, in the City, and Countrey-Commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in ſo ſaying, the Diſſwader putteth a diſhonor both upon God, and upon thoſe perſons of chief note. It is a diſhonor to God, to attribute that to the wiſdome of man, which is the mighty and gracious work of the wiſdome of God. And it is a diſhonor to ſuch men, to hold them forth as engaged to this way by the wiſdome and induſtry of men, who have been well known (and ſome of them for many years) not to have engaged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves or others any further, then the grace of Chriſt, and the conſcience of his Word hath engaged them to doe and ſuffer, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the will of God.</p>

Mr <hi>Robinſon</hi> did derive his way to his Separate Congregation at <hi>Leyden;</hi> a part of them did carry it over to <hi>Plymmouth</hi> in <hi>New-England:</hi> Here Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> took it up, and did tranſmit it to Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> who did helpe to propagate it to ſundry others in <hi>Old-England</hi> firſt, and after to more in <hi>Holland;</hi> till now by many hands it is ſown thick in divers parts of the Kingdom.</q>

And having received theſe, not from the Separatiſts, but from the Lord Jeſus, by gracious Saints, and faithfull witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of Jeſus; the conſanguinity of our Tenents with any the like found amongſt the Separatiſts, will not demonſtrate the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratiſts to be our Fathers.</p>
                  <p>It is very likely (and by the fruits of ſome of them, it is very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent) that the Church of <hi>Plymmouth</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi> received very much light and life, by the bleſſing of Chriſt upon Mr. <hi>Robinſon</hi> his Miniſtry, whilſt he lived with them in <hi>Holland:</hi> nor need we to be aſhamed, to learn any truth of God from him, or them, or from any other Saints of God, of farre meaner gifts, then he or they

And <hi>Salem</hi> it ſelfe that was gathered into Church-Order ſeven or eight yeares after them, was above 40. miles diſtant from them. And though it bee very likely,
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:124282:15"/> that ſome of the firſt commers might helpe their Theory by hearing and diſcerning their practice at <hi>Plymmouth:</hi> yet therein the Scripture is fulfilled, The Kingdome of Heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of Meal, till all was leavened, <hi>Matth.</hi> 13.13.</p>
                  <p>But yet if the Diſſwader knew the ſpirit of thoſe men who firſt came over hither, after <hi>Plymmoth,</hi> (though before us) hee would ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily diſcern, they were not ſuch as would be leavened by vicinity of neighbours, but by the Divinity of the Truth of God ſhining forth from the Word. The body of the people at that time was not of ſuch a carnall ſpirit, as ſo many of them to leave ſo faire accommodations, and dear relations in our native Countrey, to come over into a wilderneſſe, to take up a Forme of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, upon any ſuch ground as the Diſſwader conceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <q rend="margQuotes"> becauſe it holdeth out ſo much liberty, and honour to the people.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>This were indeed not to ſeek out for Liberty of Conſcience, but Elbow-roomth of luſt; and not to attend the honour, but the humor of the people. To paſſe ſuch a judgment upon ſtrangers, had need to ariſe from Divine Revelation, or elſe it will fall under the note of humane temerity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">But (ſaith the Diſſwader) howſoever it was in a few years, the moſt who ſetled their habitations in the Land, did agree to modell themſelves after <hi>Robinſons</hi> pattern.</q>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> I do not know, that they agreed upon it by any common conſultation: But it is true, they did as if they had agreed (by the ſame Spirit of Truth and unity) ſet up (by the help of Chriſt) the ſame modell of Churches, one like to another. But whether it was after Mr. <hi>Robinſons</hi> pattern, is ſpoken <hi>gratis:</hi> for I beleeve moſt of them knew not what it was, if any at all. And if any did know it, the men were ſuch, as were not wont to attend to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terns of men in matters of Religion, (for againſt that many of them had ſuffered in our native Countrey) but to the pattern of the Scriptures.</p>

                  <p>But how doth he make it appear, that I did appear in diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure againſt it?

                  </p>
                  <p>But the Diſſwader is much deceived, if he take that Error to be the judgment of the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> howſoever ſome particular perſons may lean that way.</p>
                  <p>Nor will it yeeld any better proof, that which he alledgeth out of my Preface to Mr. <hi>Hilderſons</hi> Sermon upon <hi>John.</hi> For that which I there wrote, concerneth the way of the Rigid Separa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which renounceth the Churches of <hi>England</hi> as Antichri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, and the godly members thereof, as no viſible Saints.

                  <p>But I marvail, what ſhould move the Diſſwader to report of me, <q rend="margQuotes"> That though in <hi>England</hi> I fell off from the practiſe of ſome Ceremonies, and but of ſome of them, and was diſtaſted with Epiſcopall Government: yet ſo long as I abode in <hi>England,</hi> I minded no more then the Old Non-conformity:</q> For in this one ſentence he giveth a double miſreport of me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes"> Firſt, that in <hi>England</hi> I fell off but from ſome of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</q> For (by the grace of Chriſt) I forbore all the Ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies alike at once, many years before I left <hi>England.</hi> The firſt grounds which prevailed with me to forbear one Ceremony, would not allow me to practiſe any. The grounds I well remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were two: 1 The ſignificancy and efficacy put upon them in the Preface to the Book of Common-prayer: <q rend="margQuotes">That they were neither dumb nor dark, but apt to ſtir up the dull minde of man to the remembrance of his duty to God, by ſome no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:124282:16"/> table and ſpeciall ſignification, whereby he may bee edified, or words to the like purpoſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond was the limitation of Church-power, (even of the higheſt Apoſtolicall Commiſſion) to the obſervation of the Commandements of Chriſt, <hi>Matth.</hi> 28.20. which made it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me utterly unlawfull, for any Church-power to enjoyn the obſervation of indifferent Ceremonies which Chriſt had not commanded. And all the Ceremonies were alike deſtitute of the commandement of Chriſt, though they had been indifferent otherwiſe, which indeed others have juſtly pleaded they were not.</p>
                  <p>What favor I was offered not onely for connivence, but for preferment, if I would have conformed to any one of the Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, I forbear to mention. Yea, when I was ſuſpended upon ſpeciall complaint made againſt me to the King that then was, and all hope of reſtitution denyed to me, without yeelding to ſome conformity, at leaſt in one Ceremony at leaſt once; yet the good hand of the Lord ſo kept me, that I durſt not buy my Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery ſo dear: And yet (I thank the Lord) my Miniſtery was dearer to me (to ſpeak the leaſt) then any preferment.</p>
                  <p>When the Biſhop of Lincoln-Dioceſſe (Dr. <hi>Mountaigne</hi>) offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me liberty upon once kneeling at Sacrament with him the next Lords-day after: or elſe to give ſome reaſon, why (in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience I could not) unto Dr. <hi>Davenant</hi> (then Biſhop-elect of <hi>Salisbury,</hi> who was at that time preſent with him at <hi>Weſtminſter</hi>) I durſt not accept his offer of liberty upon once kneeling; but I gave them this reaſon for my excuſe and defence,
<q>

                  </p>
                  <p>The ſecond miſreport which the Diſſwader maketh of me in his former ſentence, is, <q rend="margQuotes"> That howſoever when I was in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> I was then diſtaſted with Epiſcopall Government; yet ſo long as I abode in <hi>England,</hi> I minded no more then the Old Non-conformity.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I paſſe by his unſavory metaphor of my diſtaſte of Epiſcopall Government. Conſcientious judgment in matters of Religion is not led by taſte or diſtaſte: will he ſay, that both the Parliaments of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> have aboliſhed Epiſcopall Government upon a diſtaſte?</p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:124282:17"/>
                  <p>But when he ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">I minded no more then the Old Non-Conformity whilſt I abode in <hi>England,</hi>
                     </q> he muſt be more privie to my mind then any mortall man is, and then my ſelf too, to make it good. There were ſome ſcores of godly perſons in <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> (whereof ſome are there ſtill, and ſome here, and ſome are fallen aſleep) who can witneſſe, that we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred into a Covenant with the Lord, and one with another, to follow after the Lord in the purity of his Worſhip; which though it was defective, yet it was more then the Old Non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity. Beſides, I had then learned of Mr. <hi>Parker,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baynes,</hi> (and ſoon after of Dr. <hi>Ames</hi>) that the Miniſters of Chriſt, and the Keyes of the Government of his Church are given to each particular Congregationall Church reſpectively: And therefore neither Miniſters nor Congregations ſubject to the Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction of Cathedrall Churches, no, nor of Claſſicall Aſſemblies neither, but by voluntary conſociation, and that in ſome caſes; and thoſe falling ſhort of that which is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly called ſubjection to their Juriſdiction. Which made mee then to mind not onely a neglect of the cenſures of Commiſſary Courts, (which bred not a little offence to them, and diſturbance to my ſelf) but alſo to breath after greater lib<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rty and purity not onely of Gods Worſhip, but of Church eſtate. But ſuppoſe that I had then minded no more then the Old way of Non-conformity: yet the experience of the Godly will eaſily acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that the way of the Lord is light and ſtrength to the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right, and giveth more and more underſtanding and enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to them that walk in it.</p>
                  <p>Nay, the Diſſwaders own words might convince him, that I minded more then the Old Non-conformity, whilſt I abode in <hi>England.</hi> 
                     <q rend="margQuotes"> For if Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and thoſe Brethren who went along with me, came over to <hi>New-England,</hi> to joyn our ſelves with thoſe <hi>American</hi> Churches, (as he ſaith) it argueth plainly we did not upon our coming hither, goe contrary to our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer judgment, and fall into a liking of this way.</q> For then we would never have taken ſo long and hazardous a voyage to joyn to Churches, whoſe way was contrary to our judgments all the while of our abode in <hi>England.</hi> Rationall charity would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, that Chriſtian men, who choſe rather to forfeit our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, and maintenance, and all our dear relations in our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Countrey, then to ſubmit to a courſe contrary to our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:124282:17"/> would never tranſport our ſelves to <hi>America,</hi> to run a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary courſe to our judgments in a land of liberty.

                  <p>But to proceed, why ſhould the Diſſwader conceive, <q rend="margQuotes"> That our coming over into theſe parts, and joyning with theſe <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> Churches, ſhould cauſe this New-way (as he calleth it) to begin to grow dangerous to the reſt of the world?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To which world (I pray you) hath this way grown dangerous? to the Chriſtian world? or to the Antichriſtian world? or to the Pagan world?</p>
                  <p>The Pagan world of Indians here will acknowledg our ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting down by them, hath prevented the danger either of their diſſolution or ſervitude. For the Indians in theſe parts being by the hand of God ſwept away (many multitudes of them) by the Plague, the manner of the Neighbor-Indians is either to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the weaker Countreys, or to make them Tributary: which danger ready to fall upon their heads in theſe parts, the coming of the Engliſh hither prevented. And of late (through the grace of Chriſt) one of our fellow-Elders, Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> Teacher of <hi>Rocksbury,</hi> having gotten the knowledg of the Indian language preacheth to them every week one week to one Congregation on the fourth day, to the other on the ſixt the week following. And to him they willingly give eare, and reform their vicious living according to his Doctrine; and ſome of them offer themſelves to be trained up in Engliſh Families, and in our Schools: and there be of them that give good hope of coming on to the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the grace of Chriſt. To them therefore our way is not dangerous.</p>
                  <p>To the Antichriſtian world, the more dangerous it is; I doubt not, it is the more acceptabl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> to God, and I hope, it is not the leſſe ſafe in Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi>'s eye. Some of the Jeſuites at <hi>Lisborn,</hi> and others in the Weſtern Iſlands have profeſſed to ſome of our Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants and Mariners, they look at our Plantations, (and at ſome
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:124282:18"/> of us by name) as dangerous ſupplanters of the Catholick cauſe. If that be the greateſt danger, I preſume Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> will not <hi>ab hoc dicto ſecundum quid,</hi> pronounce us dangerous <hi>(ſimplicitèr)</hi> to the reſt of the world.</p>
                  <p>To the Chriſtian world, what danger hath accrewed by our means? many that knew both our Magiſtrates and Elders, and the chief ſort of our people, and knew how little we affected to travell into foraign Countreys to ſee faſhions; they upon our departure grew more inquiſitive into the cauſe of our voluntary exile; and thereupon, more jealous of corruptions at home in the Worſhip of God, and in Church-Diſcipline; more ſenſible of the burden and danger of Epiſcopall tyranny, and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more ready to follow the good example of the Churches and Commonwealth of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in rejecting and ſhaking off Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcopall uſurpations and intruſions of Liturgies. And hath this been ſo dangerous to the reſt of the world?</p>
                  <p>Beſides, if Books and Letters doe not delude us with falſe intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, the great ſalvation, and glorious Victories which the Lord hath wrought for <hi>England</hi> theſe late years by any Engliſh power, his own right hand hath brought to paſſe chiefly by ſuch deſpiſed inſtruments as are ſirnamed Independents. And are then the witneſſes of that way ſo dangerous to the reſt of the world?</p>
                  <p>Wherein then lyeth the danger of this way?</p>
                  <p>It ſeemeth the Diſſwader conceiveth (as ſome others have done) that this way hath bin a double danger to thoſe Churches: 1 In becomming a dangerous inlet to all kinde of Sects, who ſhrowd themſelves under the name of Independents, and claim impunity under their ſhadow. 2 In retarding the eſtabliſhment and free paſſage of the work of Reformation.</p>
                  <p>But for the former, if the devill come and ſow Tares, yea Bry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ars and Thornes, where Chriſt hath ſowen Wheate, is therefore the wheate a dangerous graine? And if thereupon not onely tares, but bryers and thornes plead for freedome from eradicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, muſt therefore the wheat be plucked up, to root out the reſt? Surely the way which is practiſed in <hi>New-England</hi> cannot juſtly be taxed for too much connivence to all kinde of Sects: wee here doe rather heare ill for too much rigour, which evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly argueth, our way is of it ſelfe no inlet at all to all kinde of Sects, unleſſe it be meerely by accident: as Chriſtianity hath been
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:124282:18"/> an inlet to all kinds of hereſie; for where there is no Chriſtianity, there is no hereſie.</p>
                  <p>As for the latter, the retarding of the worke of Reformation, Surely we find it here the readieſt way to a ſpeedy Reformation. The common diſorders obvious and ordinary in other Planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are here either not found, or ſoone Reformed. The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarding of Reformation in <hi>England</hi> ſpringeth rather, partly from ſuch as would have no Reformation at all, but affect el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bow-roomth to their owne luſts: partly from ſuch as will have no Reformation, but in their owne way. But if it might pleaſe the Lord to bow the hearts, both of the Presbyterians, and of the Congregationalls, ſo farre as both of them are come, to walke by the ſame rule, and minde the ſame thing, (both of them to minde Reformation according to the rule of the Word, as they conceive it; both of them to redreſſe abaſes, the Presbyterians, the abuſes found in their Churches, and the Congregationalls in theirs,) doubtleſſe, it need not to bee feared the worke of Reformation will ſpeedily find (by the bleſſing of Chriſt) a free and mighty paſſage through out the three Kingdomes.</p>

                  <p>Why doth he note me in his margent to be a Miſleader of Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> and others? Is it a miſleading to lead men away from the Engliſh Ceremonies?

Virgin-ſoules are wont to follow the Lambe, whereſoever hee goeth (<hi>Rev.</hi> 14.4.) And the Sonnes of God are led by the Spirit

And therefore let Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> be intreated not ſo much to undervalue his holy Brethren, as to think they were rather miſled by me, then led by the Spirit and Word of Grace in their own judgments and conſciences. It is true, Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> with ſome other godly Brethren had ſome confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence with me at <hi>London,</hi> about the cauſe of my ſufferings, and of my purpoſe to leave the Land; which they ſaid, they deſired the rather, becauſe they did not look at mee as a paſſionate man, though the Diſſwader (who knoweth me not) be pleaſed ſo to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent me to the world in this Paragraph. And upon their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion two Points were chiefely debated: 1. Touching the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Church-power, to matters of commandement, not of indifferency, (which I touched before.) The 2. touching the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Biſhops, whether the Scripture Biſhops bee appointed to rule a Dioceſſe, or a particular Congregation. Now both theſe being agreed upon amongſt us, Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> is much miſtaken, and Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> too, when they ſay, that neither Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> nor Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> nor my ſelfe did mind any further then the leaving of ſome few ceremonies. For grant the former principle, of the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of Church-Power to matters of Commandement, and all the Ceremonies muſt bee left off at once. And grant the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, touching the limitation of Biſhops to a particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation; and it will neceſſarily inferre an unavoydable Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from under the ſhadow of Dioceſan-Epiſcopall-Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, preſently after, I received Letters from Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> (and as I take it, before I left <hi>England</hi>) ſignifying, that as in our former conferences, <q rend="margQuotes"> wee had debated much of the negative part of the 2.

It is an uſuall thing with God, in times of Reformation to enlighten his Servants, though farre diſtant one from another, with the ſame beams of light of Divine Truth, which the world interpreteth, they have learned one from another: but indeed all from the ſame Spirit, who di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtributeth to every one, even as he will. But whether Mr. <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> received ought from me, I doe not know, ſure I am, I have received much from them. The members of the

                  <p>It ſemeth to me a ſtrange ſpeech of the Diſſwader, and as far from Truth, as from ingenuity, <q rend="margQuotes"> that aſſoon as I had taſted of the New Engliſh aire, I fell into a paſſionate affection with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion I found there.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For I knew their Religion before I came into <hi>New-England,</hi> and himſelf ſaid above, that I came with a purpoſe to joyn with their Churches: Which argueth, <hi>I did not fall into an affection to their Religion, by taſting of New-Engliſh Aire.</hi> Nor hath his ſpeech any reaſonable conſtruction, that with <hi>taſting the new Engliſh aire, I ſoon fell into a paſſionate affection to their Religion, unleſſe he take me for one of thoſe children, who are toſſed to and fro, and carryed about with e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very winde (or aire) of doctrine, Epheſ.</hi> 4.14. Nor doe I yet underſtand why he ſhould account the Religion of <hi>New-England</hi> another Religion, then that of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Scotland</hi> and other Reformed Churches. Difference in ſome externall form of Church admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations is not wont in the writings of judicious Divines, to make up the note and name of a different Religion.</p>
                  <p>Neither can I imagine what ſhould move him to ſay, that I <q rend="margQuotes">fell into a paſſionate affection with the Religion here.</q> A paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onate affection, is a ſtrong, yea a violent, and inordinate affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Did the Diſſwader ever reade, or hear me, to expreſſe any ſuch violent or inordinate affection to the Religion here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed?</p>
                  <p>How Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> cometh to be accounted, and called of the Diſſwader, my Convert, I doe not know. It is not good to take liberty to uſe Scripture Idioms, but in Scripture ſenſe. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſpeaketh not of converſion, but in the ſenſe of Regeneration begun, or renewed: neither doth it ſtyle one man, another mans Convert, but reſerveth that ſolely and ſolidly to the Lord.</p>
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:124282:20"/>
                  <p>But I marvail why the Diſſwader ſhould ſay, <q rend="margQuotes"> That M. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> with little adoe was brought by my Letters from <hi>New-England</hi> to follow in this ſtep of my progreſſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For firſt, I doe not remember that ever I wrote Letter to him from <hi>New-England</hi> about our way. And my Letter, which Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> quoteth amongſt his Teſtimonies (in <hi>G</hi>) was not written to him, but to a brother of mine (by Mariage) in <hi>Boſton.</hi> Men that have been bred and brought up under a form of Doctrine, or Worſhip, or Government, and never ſaw ground to ſcruple it, they may with little adoe receive it, and embrace, and follow it: which, it may be, hath been the caſe of many thouſands in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> and uſually falleth out in ſetled Churches. But for M. <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>win</hi> to take up a way not onely contrary to that wherein he hath been bred and brought up, but alſo diſcrepant from the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſo many godly learned Brethren, to the hazzard of his Miniſtery, and to the ſmothering of himſelf in a cloud of calumny and obloquy, beleeve it who will, I cannot eaſily beleeve it, that he took up ſuch a way with very little adoe. I cannot but beleeve, it coſt him many prayers, and ſighs, and grones, much ſtudy, meditation, and conference, before he could ſatisfie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in ſuch a courſe; He being eſpecially (as Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> reporteth him) a man of a fine and dainty Spirit, (and therefore loving and tender:) to which ſort of men, it is moſt unwelcome to offend Reverend Brethren by diſſenting from them: and with whom it is moſt uſuall to ſuſpect their own judgments and wayes, when they goe alone. <hi>Luther</hi> was not accounted a man of a fine and dainty ſpirit, but of a more reſolute and ſtern temper; and yet it was no ſmall temptation even to him. <q rend="margQuotes"> Nunquid tu ſolus ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pis?

                  <p>Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> his Antapology, I have not had the opportunity to come by, much leſſe to read: and therefore I cannot tell what ſenſe to make of thoſe words which Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> quoteth out of him (in <hi>H:</hi>) and wherein he ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes"> Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> was bold to boaſt of me in terms beyond the bounds of moderation.</q> Sure I am, Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> was not wont to be accounted, either a bold man, or a boaſter. I have many years known him and his modeſty, and abhorrency both from boldneſſe and boaſting: and if Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> take up a report to the contrary from Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi>
                     <pb n="27" facs="tcp:124282:20"/> (who is but one witneſſe, and it may be prejudiced) I dare not follow Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> herein, but muſt allow Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of an Elder, againſt whom no accuſation is to be received under two or three witneſſes, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.19. By what rule there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> receiveth this teſtimony againſt Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> by one ſingle witneſſe, he may doe well to conſider. Sure I am, it agreeth not with the Rules either of Congregationall or Claſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Church-government.</p>
                  <p>But if Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> himſelf doe acknowledge ſuch a ſpeech, he knoweth beſt in what ſenſe he ſpake it. For my ſelf, I can own it onely in the ſame ſenſe wherein <hi>Agur</hi> ſpake it of himſelf, <hi>Prov.</hi> 30.2, 3. <hi>Surely I am more brutiſh then man; I have not the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of a man: I have not learned wiſdome, nor know the holy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The next teſtimony which Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> quoteth out of Mr. <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards</hi> to the ſame purpoſe, ſpeaketh not of Mr. <hi>Goodwin,</hi> but of ſome other whom Mr. <hi>Edwards</hi> nameth not. But ſuch Apocry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pha teſtimonies with judicious and equall mindes, will never goe for authenticall evidences. For the matter of the teſtimony it ſelf, I conceive, the form of Church-government wherein we walk doth not differ in ſubſtance from that which Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> pleaded for. For two things chiefly there be wherein ſuch as are for a Congregationall way, do ſeem to differ from Presbyte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians: 1 In the matter of their Churches; they would have none allowed but viſible Saints. 2 In the exerciſe of Church-cenſure, they leave that power to the Elders and Brethren of the ſame Church whereof the delinquent is a member. And in both theſe we find Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi>'s footſteps going plainly before us. For, 1. he taxeth in Biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> that ſpeech of his; <q rend="margQuotes"> The Church is full of Drunkards and Whoremongers, &amp;c.</q> Whereas Mr. <hi>Cartwright</hi> would not have ſcandalous perſons born withall in the Church.

                  </p>
                  <p>The next Teſtimony which Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> alledgeth to prove Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi>'s boaſting of this new light (as he calleth it) beyond the lines of moderation, is from the words of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> in his examination of a letter of mine. His words be, <q rend="margQuotes"> That ſome of the moſt eminent amongſt them have affirmed, That even
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:124282:21"/> the Apoſtles Churches were not ſo pure as the New-Engliſh Churches.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what is this to M. <hi>Goodwin?</hi> M. <hi>Williams</hi> ſpeaketh of ſome of the moſt eminent in <hi>New-England,</hi> where Mr. <hi>Goodwin</hi> never came.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> doth not aſcribe theſe words to any defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite perſons in <hi>New-England.</hi> And, as I ſaid before, Apocrypha teſtimonies will never goe with equall mindes for authenticall evidences. It is no new thing for Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> to miſtake both himſelf and others, as hath appeared in the Reply both to his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of that Letter, and to his <hi>Bloody Tenent.</hi> I never heard of any mans ſpeech in <hi>New-England</hi> ſo hyperbolicall in the praiſe of <hi>New-Engliſh</hi> Churches, nor coming nearer to the words in hand, then the words reported of Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> himſelf: <hi>That of all the Churches in the world, the Churches of</hi> New-England <hi>were the moſt pure; and of all</hi> New-Engliſh <hi>Churches, Salem</hi> (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of himſelf was Teacher) <hi>was the pureſt.</hi> But ſuch arrogant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pariſons are as ſmoke in Gods noſtrils, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65 5. the firſt born of vanity, and the firſt ſtep to apoſtaſie.</p>

                  <p>I ſhould think my ſelf a moſt unhappy man, if <hi>England</hi> ſhould be the leſſe happy for my ſake.

                  <p>But what think ye, was that raſh and precipitate act of mine, which hath impeached the happineſſe of <hi>England?</hi> It was, ſaith he, that change of my minde. What change was that? That which I mention in a Letter to ſome friends in <hi>Boſton,</hi>

How ſhall a poor Chriſtian doe to ſatisfie his Brethren, that are not ſatisfied with their own judgment and wayes; if he be of the ſame judgment, or ſpeak the ſame thing with them? verily, it is not good in Gods ſight (but even an abomination to him) to keep a weight and a weight, a meaſure and a meaſure: to judge the ſame act in themſelves to be weighty, which in others they judge to be light and raſh.

                  <p>Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> doth indeed truly expreſſe that which (through grace) was my true intent, to clear the Orthodox Doctrine of Predeſtination from ſuch harſh conſequences, as are wonted to be derived from abſolute Reprobation. For when I was firſt called to <hi>Boſton</hi> in <hi>Lincoln-ſhire,</hi> ſo it was, that Mr. Doctor <hi>Baron,</hi> ſon of Dr. <hi>Baron,</hi> (the Divinity Reader at <hi>Cambridge</hi>) who in his Lectures there, firſt broched that which was then called Luthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raniſm, ſince Arminianiſm:) this Dr. <hi>Baron,</hi> I ſay, had leavened many of the chief men of the Town with Arminianiſm; as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indeed himſelf learned, acute, plauſible in diſcourſe, and fit to inſinuate into the hearts of his Neighbors. And though he was a Phyſitian by profeſſion, (and of good skill in that art:) yet he ſpent the greateſt ſtrength of his ſtudies in clearing and promoting the Arminian Tenents. Whence it came to paſſe, that in all the great Feaſts of the Town, the chiefeſt Diſcourſe at Table did ordinarily fall upon Arminian Points, to the great offence of the Godly Miniſters both in <hi>Boston,</hi> and Neighbor-Towns. I coming amongſt them a yong man, (as having gone to <hi>Cambridge</hi> in the beginning of the 13<hi rend="sup">th</hi> year of my age, and tarrying there not above 14 years in all, before I was ſent for to <hi>Boſton:</hi>) I thought it a part both of modeſty and prudence, not to ſpeak much to the Points, at the firſt, amongſt Strangers and Ancients: untill afterwards, after hearing of many Diſcourſes in Publick meetings, and much private conference with the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor, I had learned at length where all the great ſtrength of the Doctor lay. And then obſerving (by the helpe of Chriſt) how to avoid ſuch expreſſions, as gave him any advantage in the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of others, I then began publickly to Preach, and in private Meetings to defend the Doctrine of Gods eternall Election be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all foreſight of good or evil in the Creature: and the Redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption <hi>(ex gratiâ)</hi> only of the Ellict: the effectuall vocation of a Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner <hi>per irreſiſtibilem gratiae vim,</hi> without all reſpect of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Free will: And finally, the impoſſibility of the fal of a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere

Hereupon, when the Doctor had objected many things, and heard my anſwers to thoſe ſcruples which he was wont moſt plauſibly to urge; preſently after, our publick Feaſts and neighborly meetings, were ſilent from all further debates about Predeſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or any of the Points which depend thereon, and all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion were carryed on calmly and peaceably.

Little did I think, that a private Letter of mine written to a very friend, ſhould ever have been divulged abroad. But it ſeemeth ſome got Copies of it; and in proceſſe of time, one Copy multiplyed another, till at length it came to Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> his hand. None of his Writings againſt <hi>Armi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius</hi> or his followers had been then publiſhed: but he was then (by the report which went of him) of ſuch high eſteem with me, as I wrote him a thankfull Letter for the pains I heard he had taken in examining my Anſwer to Mr. <hi>Pells</hi> Queries: (for that was the neighbor Miniſters name who ſent them to me;) and deſired from him leave to ſee the copy of his Anſwer.

                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe two latter Tenents, immediate Revelations without the Word, and them as infallible as the Scripture it ſelf, I willingly confeſſe they are vile Montaniſm; though I would not ſay (as he doth) the vileſt. For the vileſt is, to hold <hi>Montanus</hi> himſelf to be the Holy-Ghoſt, or to have received the Holy-Ghoſt in a more full meaſure then the Apoſtles themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But for the firſt of theſe Tenents, touching the Perſonall In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation of the Holy-Ghoſt in the godly, it may further be conſidered before it be condemned. Perſonall Inhabitation may be taken in a double ſenſe: For, 1 It may hold forth no more but this, the indwelling not onely of the Gifts of the Holy-Ghoſt, but of his Perſon alſo in the Regenerate. Or 2. it may hold forth further, the indwelling of the Perſon of the Holy-Ghoſt in the Regenerate, ſo farre forth as to make us one Perſon with himſelf, or to communicate with us ſome Perſonall propriety of his own.</p>
                  <p>In this latter ſenſe Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> may well be allowed to call it, vile Montaniſm: for the Errors are vile, and alſo wrapt up in <hi>Montanus</hi> his Tenents: But for the former, the indwelling not onely of the Gifts, but of the Perſon alſo of the Holy-Ghoſt in the Regenerate, I muſt profeſſe, I neither beleeve the Tenent to be vile nor Montaniſm. Not Montaniſm, for amongſt all the Errors of <hi>Montanus</hi> or his followers, I never read this imputed to them, by ſuch as have been the moſt diligent Recorders and

Neither <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> nor <hi>Epiphanius</hi> before him, nor <hi>Daneus</hi> after him, did ever father this Tenent up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Montaniſts. Nor is the Tenent vile or erroneous, but an holy Truth of God delivered to us from the Word of Truth. As may appear,</p>

Both ſhee, and they utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed, that they held ſuch Tenents, or that they had father<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them upon mee. I returned their Anſwer to the Elders, who had ſpoken to mee of them: and I inquired, if any two of them, or of their Neighbours could bear witneſſe in this caſe. They anſwered me, they had but one witneſſe of any cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Tenent: and that one, loth to be known to bee an accuſer of them. I replyed, what courſe would you then adviſe mee to take? They anſwered, that I could not indeed bring the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Church for want of witneſſes: But the beſt way would bee, publikely and privately to bear witneſſe againſt ſuch errors. I tooke their counſell, and bare witneſſe againſt the errors complained of, as well publikely as privately. Which when ſome Elders and Brethren heard, meeting ſoon after with ſome of theſe Opinioniſts: <q rend="margQuotes">Loe, ſay they, now wee have heard your Teacher bearing witneſſe openly againſt thoſe very points, which you falſely father on him. No matter (ſay the other) what you heare him ſay in publick: we know what hee ſaith to us in private.</q> This anſwer bred in ſome of my Brethren and friends, a jealouſie, that my ſelfe was a ſecret fomenter of this ſpirit of Familiſme, if not leavened my ſelf that way. Whereupon ſundry Elders and Brethren perceiving theſe Errors to ſpread, ſecretly and cloſely, they conſulted among themſelves, and with me what I thought of a Synod, whether it might bee of uſe in ſuch a caſe for the clearing of theſe Points, and the allaying of the jealouſies and differences in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey? I anſwered, yea. Thereupon, with conſent of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates, a time, and place was appointed for a Synodicall meeting, and ſundry Elders were ſent for, from other juriſdictions, and meſſengers from all the Churches in the Country to aſſiſt in this worke.</p>
                  <p>Againſt which time three things principally were attended for preparation.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. A Solemne Faſt kept in all the Churches: in which it fell out, that Mr. <hi>Whelewrights</hi> Sermon was apprehended to give too much encouragement to the Opinioniſts. And himſelf hath ſince confeſſed, that being but new come into the Countrey, having but little acquaintance but with his kindred, and their friends, (who were many of them levened this way) he ſpake ſome things, which if he had before diſcerned their Familiſme, he would not have expreſſed himſelf as he did.</p>
                  <pb n="41" facs="tcp:124282:27"/>
                  <p>The 2. thing attended to, for preparation to the Synod, was, the gathering up of all the corrupt and offenſive Opinions that were ſcattered up and down the Countrey, and to commend them to Publique Diſquiſition in the Synod: that howſoever, the Authours of them were loth to owne them publikely, yet at leaſt, they might ſee them publickely tryed, confuted, and condemned. The which was accordingly done in the Synod: and the Opinions with their Confutations are ſince printed in the ſhort ſtory, whence Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> fetcheth many Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies.</p>
                  <p>The 3. thing thought needfull for preparation to the Synod, was, to gather out of my Sermons to the people, and my confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences (in word and writing) with the Elders, all ſuch opinions of mine as were conceived by ſome, to bee erroneous: and having gathered them together, to inquire in a brotherly conference with mee, how far I would own them, or how I did underſtand them, that ſo the true ſtate of the queſtions in difference might appeare; and withall, if there were any aguiſh diſtemper, or diſaffection growen in any of our ſpirits amongſt our ſelves, it might be healed in a private brotherly way, and mutuall ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction given and taken on all hands. Accordingly we had ſuch a meeting in private; wherein five queſtions were propounded unto mee, with deſire of my plaine and explicite anſwer to the ſame: which alſo upon their demand, I gave ſuddenly.</p>

Sometime, though the Qualification or condition bee there before, and the Spirit doe bear witneſſe to our Juſtification in that condition: yet the condition is not the cauſe either of juſtification, or of the evidence of it, as in <hi>Luke</hi> 7.47. Chriſt beareth evident witneſſe of the Remiſſion or Juſtification of <hi>Mary Magdalen,</hi> in her love to him. Nevertheleſſe her love was not the cauſe, neither of her Juſtification, nor of the aſſurance of it, but an effect of both.

Many an Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite ſtung by the fiery Serpents in the wilderneſſe, might look up to the brazen Serpent for healing, and yet at that time not look to their eye, nor think upon their eye by which they looked. And though afterwards Chriſt doe make expreſſe mention of the womans Faith, to which he attributeth her ſalvation, (<hi>Woman,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>thy Faith hath ſaved thee,</hi> ver. 50.)

                  <p>How far there aroſe any conſent or diſſent about theſe queſtions, between my Fellow-Brethren (the Elders of theſe churches) &amp; my ſelf, it is not materiall now to particuralrize; it is enough, that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our clear underſtanding of one anothers mindes &amp; judgments, and upon the due proceeding of our Church againſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced notorious errors and ſcandalls, wee have ever ſince (by the Grace of Chriſt) much amiable and comfortable Communion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in al brotherly kindneſs. But this ſhort relation may ſuffice.</p>
                  <p>To let Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> know, and all them that ſhall read his Book, to conſider, what ſlender <q rend="margQuotes">ground hee had to ſpeak of my wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring into the horrible Errors of the Antinomians, and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliſts, and ſiding therein with Miſtris <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> and therein to tell the world of a more dangerous fall of mine, then that of Montaniſme: And withall to clear up to him, what little ground Miſtris <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> had, to pretend, that ſhee was of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> judgement in all things:</q> that ſo Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> may likewiſe obſerve what ground himſelf had to take up ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port againſt me, upon her teſtimony. Which yet will the more ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeare, if I proceed to relate a principall paſſage or two in the Synod, after it was aſſembled. It was the firſt act of the Synod (after Prayer and choice of Moderators) to propound the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall offenſive opinions, which had been diſperſed up and downe in the Countrey, and briefely to argue them, and bear witneſſe againſt them. The opinions were about foureſcore (more or leſſe) which being orderly propounded and argued againſt, I perceived that ſome of the Members &amp; Meſſengers of our Church, were rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to riſe up, and plead in defence of ſundry corrupt Opinions, which I verily thought had been far from them; eſpecially ſuch as concerned union with Chriſt before Faith, Iuſtification without Fiath, inherent righteouſnes, and evidencing a good eſtate by it at all, firſt or laſt. Whereupon aſſoon as I could get liberty of ſpeech with them, <q rend="margQuotes">Brethren (ſaid I) if you be of that judgment, which you plead for, all theſe Baſtardly Opinions, which are juſtly offenſive to the Churches, will be fathered upon <hi>Boſton.</hi>
                     </q> They anſwered me again, <q rend="margQuotes">Though they were not clear for thoſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:124282:31"/> which they ſpake for, yet neither were they clear for condemning of them, conſidering the tenderneſſe of ſome Conſciences: I replyed, if they were doubtfull of the Errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſſe and danger of ſuch Opinions, they ſhould have dealt openly with the Church at home, when they were choſen Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, and ſhould have declared their judgments before the Church: as knowing ſuch points amongſt others were likely to come into agitation in the Synod: whereas now looke what they ſpeak, it is conceived by the whole Countrey to bee the judgment of our Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Hereupon ſome of the Meſſengers of our Church withdrew themſelves, and appeared no more in the Synod, ſuch as did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, did much what forbear any proſecution of argument in ſuch cauſes. But that (to my remembrance) was the firſt time of my diſcerning a real and broad difference, between the judgments of our Brethren (who leaned to Miſtris <hi>Hutchinſon</hi>) and my ſelf. And therefore to clear my ſelf, and the ſounder Members of our Church from partaking in thoſe manifold errors there preſented, I declared my judgment openly before all the aſſembly, <q rend="margQuotes">That I eſteemed ſome of the Opinions, to bee blaſphemous: ſome of them, hereticall: many of them, Erroneous: and almoſt all of them, incommodiouſly expreſſed: as intending to except thoſe chiefly, wherein I had declared mine own opinion, as before.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But becauſe I would deale openly and ingenuouſly with Mr. <hi>Baylie,</hi> and hide nothing from him, that might fortify his accuſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt me, there was ſome colour of my leaning to one An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomian Tenent in one day of the Synod. For though in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to the queſtions of the Elders before the Synod, I had affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Faith to be an inſtrument for the receiving the righteouſneſſe of Chriſt to our juſtification: yet for as much as ſome great Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vines had let fall ſome expreſſions, that ſeemed to favour the Antinomian party in a contrary Tenent, I was deſirous to hear that Point a little further ventilated, and to ſee the difficulties a little more fully cleared. Dr. <hi>Twiſſe</hi> (not ſuſpected for an Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomian, much leſſe for a Familiſt) in his <hi>vindiciae gratiae, de electione, Parte</hi> 2. <hi>Section.</hi> 25. <hi>Numero</hi> 5. bringeth in <hi>Arminius,</hi> arguing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Mr. <hi>Perkins,</hi> thus: <q>The righteouſneſſe of Chriſt wrought or performed, is not ours, as wrought or performed, but as by Faith imputed to us. </q>Whereto the Dr. anſwereth, </p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">Before Faith,
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:124282:31"/> this Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt was ours, and in the intention of God the Father, and of Chriſt our Mediator, was wrought for us. And becauſe it is wrought for us, therefore God in his own time will give it us, and Grace of every kind, even Faith it ſelf amongſt the reſt. But Faith coming, (which the Holy Ghoſt kindleth in our hearts) then at length this love of God to us in <hi>Chriſt,</hi> is acknowledged &amp; perceived. Whence it is, that the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is ſaid to bee imputed to us, by Faith, becauſe it is not deſcerned to be imputed to us, but by Faith: and then we are ſaid to be juſtified with that kind of Juſtification, &amp; abſolution from ſin, which breedeth peace in our Conſciences.
<p>And this (ſaith he) I confirm by two arguments. 1. Becauſe by the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt, wee obtain not onely Remiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of ſinnes, but Faith it ſelf, and Repentance, as it is writen, God hath bleſſed us with all ſpirituall bleſſings in Chriſt, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.3. Therefore even before Faith and Repentance, the Righteouſneſſe of Chriſt is applyed to us, as for which wee obtain Grace effectuall to believe in Chriſt, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent. 2. Becauſe Juſtification and abſolution, as they ſignify an immanent act in God, are <hi>ab aeterno, &amp;c.</hi>

                  </q>
                  <p>Before Dr. <hi>Twiſſe, Chamier</hi> (a Divine, as free as the other from ſuſpition of Antinomianiſme) denyeth Faith to bee a cauſe of Juſtification; <q rend="margQuotes">For if it were (ſaith hee) Juſtification ſhould not be of Grace, but of us. But Faith is ſaid to juſtifie, not becauſe it effecteth Juſtification, but becauſe it is effected in the juſtified perſon, and requiſite to be found in him.</q> 
                     <hi>De Fide libr.</hi> 13. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. And to the ſame purpoſe, <hi>De Juſtificatione, libr.</hi> 22. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. hee contendeth, <q rend="margQuotes">that Faith as it doth not merit, nor bring Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication,ſo neither doth it <hi>(impetrare)</hi> obtain it. For if it were ſo, then <hi>tum ratione, tum tempore Fides praecederet Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficationem,</hi> Faith ſhould goe before Juſtification, both in nature and time: Which (ſaith hee) in no ſort may be granted. For Faith is it ſelf a part of Sanctification; but there is no San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification, but after Juſtification, <hi>quae &amp; re, &amp; naturâ prior eſt,</hi> which both in the thing it ſelf, and in nature is before it.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>To the like purpoſe doth Mr. <hi>Pemble</hi> deliver his judgment in his Book of the Nature and Properties of Grace and Faith,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:124282:32"/> 
                     <hi>Page</hi> 24. 26. of his Edition in Folio.</p>
                  <p>The Diſcrepance of all theſe Divines from the received expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the moſt, gave juſt occaſion, why in ſuch an Aſſembly, the judgment of ſundry acute and judicious Elders, might be enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Accordingly, in one day of their diſpute in the Synod (with Mr. <hi>Whelewright,</hi> if I forget not) I interpoſed ſuch a word as this, God may bee ſaid to juſtifie me before the habit, or act of Faith, and the habit is the effect of my Juſtification, intending the ſame ſenſe, as hath been expreſſed out of thoſe Divines: upon which, the next day was taken up in diſputing and arguing that Point with mee. And when I ſaw their apprehenſions, that they were ſuitable to Scripture phraſe, and the contrary difficulties might bee removed <hi>ſano ſenſu,</hi> I the next morning did of my ſelf freely declare to them publikely, my conſent with them in the point, which (as they profeſſed) they gladly accepted.</p>
                  <p>Now upon all this relation (which is the ſubſtance of the whole Truth in this cauſe) I deſire Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> might conſider what ground hee had, <q rend="margQuotes">either to report mee to the World as ſometimes dangerouſly fallen into the horrible Errors of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinomianiſme, and Familiſme: or to take Ms. <hi>Hutchinſons</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port in this cauſe, That ſhe was of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> judgment in all things.</q> Let him pleaſe to read the ſhort ſtory of the Errors and hereſies, for which ſhee was admoniſhed publickly in <hi>Boſton</hi> Church, and compare them with the Tenents of mine now men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, and let him judge of himſelf, whether ſhe was of Mr. <hi>Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> judgment in all things.</p>
                  <p>I would not have enlarged my ſelf ſo much, either to clear her teſtimony, or to elevate it, were it not to take off ſome ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples and ſurmiſes in Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> of ſome dangerous guilt in me of Antinomian, and Familiſticall errors, which he thinkes cannot be avoided by what he collecteth from other teſtimonies, as well as hers which may fully be prevented and avoided by this relation of the true ſtate of things.</p>
                  <p>But before I leave ſpeech of her, let me ſpeak a word to Mr. <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie</hi> of the Epithet hee is pleaſed to give her, <q rend="margQuotes">when hee ſtyleth her, my dear friend, with whom I reſolved to ſide and ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from all the Churches in <hi>New-England,</hi> as Legall Churches.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At her firſt comming ſhe was well reſpected and eſteemed of me,
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:124282:32"/> not onely becauſe herſelf and her family were well beloved in <hi>England</hi> at <hi>Allford</hi> in <hi>Lincolnſhire</hi> (not far beyond <hi>Boſton:</hi>) nor onely becauſe ſhe with her family came over hither (as was ſaid) for conſcience ſake: but chiefly for that I heard, ſhee did much good in our Town, in womans meeting at Childbirth-Travells, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſhee was not onely skilfull and helpfull, but readily fell into good diſcourſe with the women about their ſpiritual eſtates: And therein cleared it unto them, That the ſoul lying under a Spirit of Bondage, might ſee and ſenſibly feel the hainous guilt, and deep deſert of ſin, and thereby not onely undergoe affliction of Spirit but alſo receive both reſtraining, and conſtraining Grace likewiſe, (in ſome meaſure:) reſtraining from all known evill (both courſes, and companies) (at leaſt for a ſeaſon) and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining to all knowen duties, as ſecret Prayer, Family Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes, Conſcience of Sabbaths, Reverence of Miniſters, Frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Sermons, Diligence in calling, honeſty in dealing and the like: yea and that the Soul might find ſome taſtes and flaſhes of ſpirituall comfort in this eſtate, and yet never ſee or feel the need of Chriſt, much leſſe attain any ſaving Union, or Communion with him, being no more but Legall work, even what the Law, and the Spirit of bondage (breathing in it) might reach unto. By which means many of the women (and by them their hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands) were convinced, that they had gone on in a Covenant of Works, and were much ſhaken and humbled thereby, and brought to enquire more ſeriouſly after the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, without whom all their Gifts and Graces would prove but common, and their duties but legall, and in the end wizzen and vaniſh. All this was well (as is reported truely, <hi>page</hi> 31. of her Story) and ſuited with the publike Miniſtery, which had gone along in the ſame way, ſo as theſe private conferences did well tend to water the ſeeds publikely ſowen. Whereupon all the faithfull embraced her conference, and bleſſed God for her fruitfull diſcourſes. And many whoſe ſpirituall eſtates were not ſo ſafely layed, yet were hereby helped and awakened to diſcover their ſandy foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to ſeek for better eſtabliſhment in Chriſt: which cauſed them alſo to bleſſe the Lord for the good ſucceſſe, which appeared to them by this diſcovery.</p>
                  <p>Hitherto therefore ſhee wrought with God, and with the Miniſters, the work of the Lord. No marvell therefore if at that time, ſhee found loving and dear reſpect both from our Church-Elders
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:124282:33"/> and Brethren, and ſo from my ſelf alſo amongſt the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards, it is true, ſhe turned aſide not only to corrupt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but to diſ-eſteem generally the Elders of the churches, (though of them ſhee eſteemed beſt of Mr. <hi>Shepheard:</hi>) and for my ſelfe, (in the repetitions of Sermons in her houſe) what ſhee repeated and confirmed, was accounted ſound, what ſhee omitted, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted Apocrypha. This change of hers was long hid from me: and much longer the evidence of it, by any two clear witneſſes. I ſent ſome Siſters of the Church on purpoſe to her Repetitions, that I might know the truth: but when ſhee diſcerned any ſuch preſent, no ſpeech fell from her, that could be much excepted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt. But further diſcourſe about her courſe is not pertinent to the preſent buſineſſe. But by this Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> may diſcerne, how farre Ms. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> was dear unto mee, and if hee ſpeak of her as my deare friend, till ſhee turned aſide, I refuſe it not.</p>
                  <p>But yet thus much I muſt profeſſe to him, That in the times of her beſt acceptance, ſhee was not ſo dear unto mee, but that (by the help of Chriſt) I dealt faithfully with her about her ſpirituall eſtate. There things I told her, made her ſpirituall eſtate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clear to mee.</p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">1. That her Faith was not begotten nor (by her relation) ſcarce at any time ſtrengthened, by publick Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, but by private Meditations, or Revelations onely.
<p n="2">2. That ſhee clearly diſcerned her Juſtification (as ſhee pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed:) but little or nothing at all, her Sanctification: though (ſhe ſaid) ſhee beleeved, ſuch a thing there was by plain Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. That ſhe was more ſharply cenſorious of other mens ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall eſtates and hearts, then the ſervants of God are wont to be, who are more taken up with judging of themſelves before the Lord, then of others.</p> Now a word of that other paſſage, in Mr. <hi>Baylies</hi> ſpeech, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my reſolution to ſide with Ms. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> and to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate from all the Churches of <hi>New-England,</hi> as legall Syna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gogues</q>
                  <p>The truth is, I did intended to remove, but not to Separate; much leſſe with Ms. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> and leaſt of all from all the Churches of <hi>New-England:</hi> and yet leſſe then the leaſt of all, to ſeparate from them, as legall Synagogues.</p>
                  <p>The occaſion of my intent of removall was this. After the
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:124282:33"/> baniſhment of Ms. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> and ſundry others by occaſion of her, the generall court made an order, that none ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to abide as Inhabitants in this Jurisdiction, unleſſe they were allowed under the hand of the Governour, or two Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants. The Aſſiſtants are our Magiſtrates. When this Law came to be put in ure, I was informed that ſome godly paſſengers who hither arrived out of <hi>England,</hi> were refuſed to ſit down amongſt us, becauſe (upon tryall) they held forth ſuch an union with Chriſt by the Spirit giving Faith, as did precede the acting of Faith upon Chriſt: and ſuch an evidence of that union, by the favour of God ſhed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghoſt, as did precede the ſeeing (though not the being) of Sanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>This took the deeper impreſſion upon me, becauſe I ſaw by this meanes, wee ſhould receive no more Members into our Church, but ſuch as muſt profeſſe themſelves of a contrary judgment to what I beleeved to bee a Truth. Beſides I was informed, that it was the judgment of ſome of place, in the Countrey, that ſuch a Doctrin of Union, and evidencing of Union, as was held forth by mee, was the <hi>Trojan</hi> Horſe, out of which all the erroneous Opinions and differences of the Countrey did iſſue forth.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, fearing this might in time breed a renewall of Paro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zyſmes, I called to mind the intent of my comming hither, which was, not to diſturb, but to edify the Churches here: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore began to entertain thoughts rather of peaceable removall then of offenſive continuance. At the ſame time there was brought to mee a writing, ſubſcribed with about threeſcore hands to encourage me to removall, and offering their readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe to remove with mee into ſome other part of this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey.</p>
                  <p>I conſidered, If wee removed, it would be matter of much va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conſtruction amongſt ſuch as knew us, both in <hi>Old-England,</hi> and <hi>New;</hi> and I was loth to doe any thing, (eſpecially of impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance) but what I might give account of before God, and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; I took advice therefore of ſome friends here, eſpecially Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> and reſolved, firſt to clear the certainty of the grounds of the information given mee of the rejections of thoſe godly perſons (of whom I had heard) for their judgments ſake in thoſe points. 2. To ſee if my continuance here would certainly, or
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:124282:34"/> probably breed any further offenſive agitation: And 3. If both thoſe things were found clearly, then to take opportunity with common conſent to remove to <hi>Quinipya<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>k</hi> whereto at that time a door was opened.</p>
                  <p>But when I came to enquire the certainty of theſe informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, in conference with ſome of our chief Magiſtrates and others, I found, though there had ſpeach been about ſuch points between themſelves, and ſome paſſengers: yet their refuſall of ſuch paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers was not upon thoſe points, but (as I remember) upon denyall of inherent righteouſneſſe in beleevers, and of any evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of a good eſtate from thence, firſt or laſt. Withall, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to mee their minds touching ſuch points of Union, or evidencing of Union, which I had taught, that they did not looke at them to bee of ſuch Fundamentall concernment either to civill or Church-Peace, as needed to occaſion any diſtance in heart, (much leſſe in place) amongſt godly brethren. Which when I heard from them, and found upon ſearch, the miſ-infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations given mee, were but miſpriſions, I then layed down all thoughts of removall, and ſat down ſatisfied in my aboad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, and have ſo continued (by the help of God) to this day. By all this may appear the truth of what I ſaid, that though I had thoughts of removall, yet not with Ms. <hi>Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> ſhee being gone to <hi>Road Iſland,</hi> but I intending <hi>Quinipyack.</hi> Much leſſe had I any thoughts of Separation from all the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of <hi>New-England:</hi> for the Churches in <hi>Quinipiack</hi> are in <hi>New-England.</hi> And thoſe Churches at the <hi>Bay</hi> (amongſt whom I lived) It was far from my thoughts to ſeparate from them, whom I ever truely honored as the holy Spouſes of Jeſus Chriſt. Nor did I ever look at ſuch Points, as any juſt ground of Separation from any Church, (ſo much as in place, much leſſe in Communion:) no nor any juſt ground of removall from them, unleſſe a man were compelled to profeſſe contrary to his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And leaſt of all durſt I turn my back upon ſuch Churches as Legall Synagogues, who do all of us hold Union with Chriſt, and evidencing of Union by the ſame Spirit, and the ſame Faith and the ſame holineſſe: though ſome may conceive the Union wrought in giving the habit, and others rather refer it to the act: and ſome may give the ſecond place to that, whereto others give the firſt.</p>
                  <p>It was therefore too much credulity in Mr. <hi>Baylie,</hi> either to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:124282:34"/> take up the former teſtimony from Ms. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> or this latter from Mr. <hi>Williams:</hi> though if both of them had joyned in one and the ſame Teſtimony, (which they doe not) yet the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of two excommunicate Perſons doth not make up <hi>idoneum Teſtimonium</hi> in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes"> No? Saith Mr. <hi>Baylie,</hi> if I miſtake not the humor of the man, (Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> he meaneth) he is very unwilling to report a lie of his greateſt enemy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I look not at my ſelf, as his greateſt, or leaſt, or any ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at all. I doe not know, that I did ever walke towards him either in the affection, or action of an enemy, notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the provoking injuries, and indignities hee hath put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on mee.</p>
                  <p>Nor would I call it any mans humor (as Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> calleth it, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his humor) <q rend="margQuotes">to be very unwilling to report a lye of his greateſt enemy.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this I ſay, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> is too too credulous of ſurmiſes and reports brought to him, and too too confident in divulging of them. Which if Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> know not, hee may (at his leiſure, if hee think it worth the while) peruſe the Reply, I have made to his anſwer of my Letter, as alſo my anſwer to his bloody Tenent.</p>
                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> giveth the more credit to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his Teſtimony, becauſe Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſaith in his examination of my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The anſwer is very eaſie both to Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> too, that Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> ſpeaketh of the times before his baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: then indeed he had ſome fellowſhip with us, and might have had more, but that hee ſupected all the <hi>Statos conventus</hi> of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to bee unwarrantable, and ſuch as might in time make way to a Presbyteriall government.

                  <q rend="margQuotes">But yet (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi>) the truth of this horrible fall (of Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi>) if you will not take it, neither from the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Ms. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> nor from the Teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams:</hi> yet wee may not reject the witneſſe of Mr. <hi>Winthrop,</hi> and of Mr. <hi>Wells</hi> in their printed relations of the Schiſmes there.
<p>Both theſe, albeit, with all care and ſtudy, they endeavour to ſave Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> credit: yet they let the truth of Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> Seduction fall from their Pens in ſo clear termes, as cannot bee avoided: yea ſo clear, as no Art will get Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> cleared.</p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding al this confident charge of Mr. <hi>Baylie,</hi> there will be no need at al of any Art to clear Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> from ſeduction into any ſuch horrible fall, the naked truth (by the helpe of Chriſt) will clear both it ſelf, and him. The Teſtimonies of Mr. <hi>Winthrop,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Wells,</hi> are all delivered (as it ſeemeth) in the ſhort Story. There</p>
                  <p>In the Preface, <hi>page</hi> 7. It is ſaid, <q rend="margQuotes">By this time, they had to pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troniſe them, ſome of the Magiſtrates, and ſome men eminent for Religion, Parts and Wit.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. This were ſomething, if there were no more men eminent for Religion, Parts and Wit, in the Country but my ſelf, who profeſſe no eminency in any of theſe in reſpect of many of my Brethren. But if I were eminent, the teſtimony concludeth not. Let not Art judge, whether the concluſion will follow from both the premiſes particular: but let common ſenſe judge of ſuch men, as then lived in the Countrey, whether there were not many eminent perſons for Religion, Parts, and Wit, who did patroniſe them, though I had been out of the Countrey.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I willingly confeſſe, that I my ſelf, though I did not patro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſe them, yet I did countenance them (in my meaſure) whilſt they held forth (to my knowledge) no more then I have formerly delivered of my own Tenents: which yet I hope he will not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain tax, as an horrible fall into Antinomianiſme and Familiſm. When their Errors were brought to me, I bare publike witneſſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them, even before I was fully perſwaded that thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons were guilty of them.</p>
                  <p>His next Teſtimony (which hee quoteth from <hi>page</hi> 25. of the ſhort Story) the former part of it concerneth Mr. <hi>Whelewright,</hi> and not mee: though I muſt confeſſe I doe not know how it can be
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:124282:35"/> collected from Mr. <hi>Whelewrights</hi> doctrin, unleſſe it were by a fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtalled miſ-apprehenſion and miſ-application of thoſe hearers, who were leavened with corrupt Opinions. The latter part of the teſtimony, <q rend="margQuotes">That the former Governor never ſtirred out, but at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by the Serjants with Halberts or Carrabines, but the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Governor was neglected:</q> I do not remember, that ceremony was any more then once neglected: and when I heard it, I bore witneſſe againſt it. And they excuſed their former obſervance, by the eminency of the perſon. But ſure I am, the preſent Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or (as he well deſerveth all honor from this Peopole, ſo) he is ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome or never ſeen in publick, but in like ſort attended with Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berts or Carrabines.</p>
                  <p>Next, he alledgeth a teſtimony from the Court, which (it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) was delivered by Mr. <hi>Winthrop,</hi> being then Governor, <hi>page</hi> 35. of the ſhort Story: <q rend="margQuotes">They ſoon profited ſo well, as in a few moneths, they outwent their Teacher.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This teſtimony is ſo far from taxing mee of any horri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble fall, that it clearly acquiteth mee from the fellowſhip thereof. For if they outwent their Teacher, as the Court ſaid (and ſaid truely:) then I went not along with them in their Tenents. And Teacher I was called, and their Teacher, as being called to that Office in that Church, whereof many of them were Members.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This might indeed argue, that ſome Magiſtrates leaned more or leſſe to that way: but it reacheth not me, who am ſeldome preſent at any Courts, but when with other Elders I am ſent for. And let it not be forgotten, what I related above, that many held with thoſe Opinioniſts (as they were called) when they knew of no other opinions held forth by them, but what was publickly taught in our Church: but after they were diſcovered to overgoe not ſo much their Teachers, as the truth, and that ſo evidently, as could clearly be convinced by the teſtimony of two or three wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, they were ſoon forſaken by thoſe, who eſteemed better of them before.</p>
                  <p>His next teſtimony is from the ſtory <hi>page</hi> 32. </p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">It was a wonder, upon what a ſuddain, the whole Church of <hi>Boſton</hi>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> That moſt of the Church of <hi>Boſton</hi> conſented with Ms. <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> (whilſt ſhee openly held forth no more, then what was publickly taught) is true; but nothing to prove Mr. <hi>Cottons</hi> horrible fall, for after ſhee fell into any horrible, or evident er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors, it may clearly appear, the whole Church were not become her canverts, by this undenyable evidence, that the whole body of the Church (ezcept her own ſon) conſented with one accord, to the publick cenſure of her, by admonition firſt, and excommuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation after.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">But (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi>) None of theſe erroneous perſons were ever called to account by the Presbytery of that Church, till after the Aſſembly, though the Paſtor of the Church, Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> was alwayes exceeding zealous againſt them.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> is miſtaken, when he ſaith, Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> was alwayes exceeding zealous againſt them. For the whole Church will bear him witneſſe, hee was a long time full of much forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance towards them, and thought well of them, and bare witneſſe to the wayes of free Grace in ſuch manner, as teſtified his good will to them and the Truth. Afterwards in ſome private confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, which one or more of them had with him, and (our belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Siſter) his Wife, he diſcerned ſome more rottenneſſe in them, and their way, then he ſuſpected before: And after that time in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, he grew more zealous againſt them, but the occaſion of the offence was private, and (for a good ſpace) unknown both to mee and the Church.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. But why they were not called to account by the Presbytery of the Church, the reaſon was evident: becauſe their groſſe errors were not confirmed into us, by two or three witneſſes. And this I can truely profeſſe, That when the Elders of other Churches acquainted mee with ſome of their Errors, (even when the noiſe of them was ſpred far and neer:) yet they acknowledged, the Erroneous perſons were ſo cautious, that they would never vent any groſſe Errors before two witneſſes. And this I can further truely avouch, that my ſelf dealt ſadly and ſeriouſly with ſome chief leaders of them, both by word, and writing to recover them from the Error of their way: which though they would argue
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:124282:36"/> for, yet they would ever excuſe themſelves from ſetling upon any ſuch things. I dealt alſo with others (whom I began to ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect might be leavened by their Leaders) and earneſtly charged them to beware what Tenents they received from them, leſt by that means they might be corrupted themſelves, and their Leaders hardned. But they would not bee known to me, that they drunke in any ſuch dregs, as afterwards appeared.</p>
                  <p>His next teſtimony is taken from Ms. <hi>Hutchinſons</hi> ſpeach in the open Court, <q rend="margQuotes">Preferring my Miniſtery in holding forth free Grace, above ſome, or moſt of the other Elders.</q> But of the invalidity of her teſtimony in theſe things I have ſpoken, (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) enough above. An evill Spirit (which ſometimes breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth both in good and bad perſons,) may give a glorious teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to ſome ſervants of God, not ſo much to honour them, or their doctrine, as either to cover themſelves under their ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, or elſe (but that was not her aime) to bring them and their Doctrin into ſuſpition, and trouble, as the Spirit of the <hi>Pythoneſſe</hi> did to <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas, Act.</hi> 16, 17, to 20. That ſpeach of hers, I bore witneſſe againſt it, as prejudiciall and injurious both to them and mee.</p>
                  <p>Another teſtimony hee alledgeth out of the Story, <hi>Page</hi> 50. <q rend="margQuotes">That all the Miniſters conſented in bearing ſome witneſſe againſt Mr. <hi>Whelewright,</hi> except their Brother the Teacher of <hi>Boſton.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The Story relateth thoſe words, as the ſpeach of the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; that they ſpeak of me, as their Brother, to wit, the brother of the Elders, leſt any ſhould miſconceive of their ſpeach, as ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me in a Brotherhood with erroneous perſons.</p>
                  <p>That I did not conſent with the reſt of my Brethren (the El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) in drawing the inference out of Mr. <hi>Whelewrights</hi> Sermon, which they (being required) preſented to the Court, I had a twofold reaſon for it. 1. Becauſe I was not preſent with them, when they ſearched Mr. <hi>Whelewrights</hi> Sermon, and gathered that inference from it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2 Becauſe I could not ſpeake it of mine own knowledge, <q rend="margQuotes">That the Elders of the Country did walk in or teach ſuch a way of Salvation, and evidencing thereof, as Mr. <hi>Whele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wright</hi> deſcribedeth, and accounteth to bee a Covenant of Works.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>They knew what themſelves taught in that point, better
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:124282:37"/> then I. The Elders might teſtifie what they knew: I could not te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifie, what I knew not. But it ſeemeth any teſtimonies will ſerve turn, when ſuch as theſe are thought unavoidable, to lay me un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the guilt of an horrible fall.</p>
                  <p>Yet one more remaineth, from <hi>page</hi> 21. <q rend="margQuotes">That albeit the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of the Churches had confuted and condemned moſt of theſe new opinions, and Mr. <hi>Cotton</hi> had in publick view conſented with the reſt: yet the leaders in thoſe Erroneous wayes ſtood ſtill to maintain their New Light. Mr. <hi>Whelewright</hi> alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued his Preaching, and Ms. <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> her wonted meetings: and much offence was ſtil given by her, and others in going out from the Paſtors Exerciſe.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. As the Aſſembly of the Churches confuted and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned thoſe Errors, ſo I will not ſay, That the motion of confuting them (as I remember) aroſe from my ſelf. And my ſelf alſo had an hand in confuting ſuch of them, as the Elders com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to my hand, as themſelves took ſeverall likewiſe taskes, none of us confuted all. My conſent to the confutation, I have expreſſed above, and in what ſenſe. What I did in publick view (as the Story expreſſeth it) I ſpake before the Lord, and from the truth of my heart.</p>
                  <p>That notwithſtanding this Act of the Aſſembly againſt the Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, the leaders ſtill ſtood to maintain their way, it was becauſe the Aſſembly did not faſten theſe Errors upon any Perſons ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in our own, or other Churches. And what corrupt opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons were maintained by our Members, it was done in private, and not before ſuch witneſſes, as might reach to publick conviction.</p>
                  <p>Mr. <hi>Whelewrights</hi> continuance in his preaching, was 8. or 9. miles diſtance from us. And having been put into that place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore by the Church, whilſt the Farmers there belonged to our Church, (which by reaſon of the diſtance, wee ſoon after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed into a Church-eſtate amongſt themſelves) wee that were Elders could not (if wee would) diſcharge him from that worke, without the conſent of the Church. But though hee gave ſome offence in ſome paſſages at the Aſſembly, (which hee ſince upon further conference and conſideration retracted:) yet neither the Church, nor my ſelf (notwithſtanding thoſe unſafe expreſſions) did ever look at him, either as an Antinomian or Familiſt. Many of us knew that hee had taken good paines againſt both, and in that very place, where hee was wont to preach; inſomuch that
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:124282:37"/> one of his hearers (who ſince joyned to Mr. <hi>Gortons</hi> ſociety) open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conteſted againſt his doctrine as falſe and Antichriſtian. And when Mr. <hi>Whelewright</hi> was put out of this Countrey (though hee be ſince reſtored) yet if hee had cleaved to the Errors which Ms. <hi>Hutchinſons</hi> company fell into, he would never have refuſed their earneſt invitation and call of him, to Miniſter unto them. They ſent to him, and urged him much to come to them, to a far richer ſoyle, and richer company then where hee lived: yet hee conſtantly refuſed, and upon that very ground, becauſe of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption of their judgments: <q rend="margQuotes">Profeſſing often, whilſt they plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the Covenant of Grace, they took away the Grace of the Covenant.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Ms. <hi>Hutchinſons</hi> continuance of her weekly meetings we could not proceed to the ſuppreſſion thereof, with conſent of the Church, before wee received the conviction of her perſonall Errors, which ſhee ſtill cloſely carryed, till after her civill cenſure. And then ſhee declared her ſelf more plainly, and wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes aroſe more fully, and the Church proceeded againſt her accordingly.</p>
                  <p>The going of her ſelf and others out of the Congregation when our Paſtor began to Exerciſe, though many feared it was a turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their backs upon his Miniſtery: yet the moſt of them were women, and they pretended many excuſes for their going out, which it was not eaſie to convince of falſhood in them, or of their contempt of him.</p>
                  <p>But in fine, when her Antinomian and Familiſticall Errors were held forth by her before ſufficient witneſſes, our Church (as I ſaid before) proceeded without delay, firſt, to admoniſh her according to the rule, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.10, 11. Afterwards when upon ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious paines taken with her, Mr. <hi>Davenport,</hi> and my ſelf (as wee thought) had convinced her of her erroneous wayes in judgment and practice, ſo as that under her hand, ſhee preſented a Recan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation before the whole Church, (indeed before many Churches then aſſembled at <hi>Boſton</hi>) yet withall, (after ſome paſſages of ſpeach) <q rend="margQuotes">Profeſſing that ſhee never was of any other judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,then what ſhe now held forth,</q> ſo many witneſſes forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with roſe up to convince the contrary, that with common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent both of the Elders and Brethren of our Church, ſhee was caſt out of our Communion.</p>
                  <p>And now that (by the help of Chriſt) I have peruſed all the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:124282:38"/> teſtimonies, which Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> hath alledged to convince me of an horrible fall into Antinomianiſm, and Familiſm, I deſire him in the fear of God to conſider, whether any or all theſe teſtimonies ſeverally or jointly, will amount to make good ſuch grievous ſcandalls, as hee hath charged upon mee. Which if they neither will, nor can reach unto, let him remember his promiſe in his Epiſtle Dedicatory, <q rend="margQuotes">That in all which he hath ſaid over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove (juſt teſtimony) he will undertake to give ample ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, wherein ſo ever he hath given the leaſt offence to any.</q> Meane while the Lord lay not this ſin to his charge.</p>

                     <q rend="margQuotes">This other more dangerous fall (ſaith hee) as it hath already much humbled his Spirit, and opened his eare to inſtruction, and I truſt will not leave working, till it have brought him yet nearer to his Brethren: ſo to the worlds end, it cannot but be a matter of fear and trembling to all, who ſhall know it, and of abundant caution, to bee very wary of receiving any ſingula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from his hand, without due tryall.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Suppoſe all this were true <hi>in terminis,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> hath expreſſed it, yet this were no impeachment at all to the doctrin and practice of that (which hee calleth) our Independent Church way; nor is it any juſt ground of caution to bee wary of receiving my teſtimony to it. <hi>Peters</hi> dangerous and dreadfull fall into the denyall of Chriſt, (though hee ſeemed to be a pillar) was no impeachment, but advancement to Chriſtianity. And if my fall were ſo dangerous, walking in this Church-way, and ſtumbling ſo foully in it, the greater Grace and witneſſe from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven was upon his Churches in this way, who by the bleſſing of God were inſtruments of recovering me out of this fall, even by a conſultatory conference in a Synod, which did not aſſume to themſelves any power of Church-cenſures. Let mee be accounted to have fallen, and to have fallen (as Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> repreſenteth it)
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:124282:38"/> horribly, ſo that the truth and wayes of Chriſt may ſtand and find free paſſage.</p>
                  <p>Neither is this fall of mine ſuch a juſt ground of caution (as he would make it) unto any, to bee very wary of receiving my teſtimony to this Church way. For the way is no way of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity from my hand, but that which the body of the reſt of my Brethren, and of the Churches in this Country doe walk in with mee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. But yet, let not Mr. <hi>Baily</hi> make further ſpeech or uſe of my humiliation, then was performed, or intended by me. For God hath not given mee to this day (upon my beſt ſearch) to diſcerne any ſuch dangerous fall into Antinomianiſme, or Familiſme, as either hath, or might much humble my ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>It is true, my ſpirit had much cauſe to be humbled, (and ſo through mercy it was) upon many juſt occaſions at that time. As firſt, that ſo many Erroneous and Hereticall opinions ſhould be broached in the Country, and carried on with ſuch Arrogan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and Cenſoriouſneſſe, and guile of ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, That the principall offenders in this kind were members of our own Church, and ſome of them ſuch as had neer relation to my ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, that my ſelf ſhould be ſo ſleepy and invigilant, as that theſe (not Tares onely, but Bryers) ſhould be ſowen in our Field, and my ſelf not diſcerne them, till ſundry perſons up and down the Countrey were leavened by them.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that ſuch as endeavoured the healing of theſe diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, did ſeeme to me to be tranſported with more jealouſies, and heates, and paroxyſmes of ſpirit, then would well ſtand with brotherly love, or the rule of the Goſpel.</p>
                  <p>The bitter fruits whereof doe remaine to this day, in the Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſent over that year from hence to <hi>England.</hi> Whence alſo it came to paſſe finally, that in the courſe taken for the clenſing of Gods Field, it ſeemed to me, that ſome good Wheat was pluckt up with the Tares, ſome ſimple hearted honeſt men, and ſome truths of God, fared the worſe for the reſemblance which the tares bare to them.</p>
                  <p>Upon all which grounds, my ſelf with our whole Church thought it needfull to ſet a day apart for publick humiliation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord, wherein theſe and the like, both in Prayer and Preaching, were opened more at large before the Lord and his people.</p>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:124282:39"/>
                  <p>But all this will not amount to make good Mr. <hi>Baylies</hi> word, <q rend="margQuotes">That my dangerous fall into Antinomianiſme and Familiſme hath much humbled my Spirit.</q>

                  <p>But whether he have read of any of our books of that Subject, or no, ſurely it is not, becauſe none of ſuch are extant to bee read. He may read when he pleaſeth Mr. <hi>Shepards</hi> two Treatiſes, one ſtiled The ſincere Convert, the other The ſound Beleever, beſides fundry Treatiſes of Mr. <hi>Hooker</hi> touching the Soules Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to Chriſt, Effectuall Calling, and Juſtification, &amp;c. and when he hath read them, let him then tell the world, whether of all that have croſſed the <hi>American</hi> Seas (as hee ſpeaketh) the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of this way have been juſtly noted to be moſt neglectfull of the work of converſion. Yea let me make bold in Gods feare to pray Mr. <hi>Baylie,</hi> and thoſe others, who have noted us as moſt neglectfull of this work, to enquire and conſider whether among all the ſervants of Chriſt now living in any reformed Churches (put them all together) they have publiſhed ſo many Treatiſes of the work of converſion, as the Miniſters of this way have done, in <hi>New-England,</hi> and <hi>London,</hi> which I ſpeak not (the Lord is witneſſe to my ſoule) out of carnall Arrogancy to boaſt of our labours, in ſo holy and weighty an Argument: but out of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to beare witneſſe to the way of Gods truth againſt ſuch an unjuſt &amp; unworthy ſcandall. But when I ſpeak of theſe Treatiſes of Converſion, I do not include all that are written under the glorious and fallacious ſtiles of Free Grace, and Goſpel-Truth, which nevertheleſſe doe but indeed lay the Leaven of Arminian-univerſall-free
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:124282:45"/> Grace, and Antinomian Impenitency: but I ſpeak of thoſe Treatiſes which are pure from ſuch Leaven, as keeping the patterne of wholeſome words and ſound doctrin, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding the Word of truth aright, in the right uſe of the Law and Goſpel, wherein though they ſometime declare ſuch works of Grace to be preparations to converſion, which others do take to be fruits of converſion: yet they all agree in this, that ſuch works are found in all that are under the powerfull and effectuall ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving work of the Spirit, and Word of Chriſt, and in none elſe, which is the light and life of the Saints in Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>I will not here ſpeak of the converſion of <hi>Weaquaſh,</hi> which (as I heare) is publiſhed in a little Script, intituled, <hi>New-Englands</hi> Firſt-fruits. Nor would I have mentioned the endeavours of ſome of our fellow-Brethren here, to helpe forward the work of converſion in <hi>Virginia,</hi> were it not that the bleſſing of the Lord Jeſus upon their labours doth call for acknowledgment. Some honeſt minded people in <hi>Virginia</hi> diſcerning their want of ſpirituall Miniſtery, ſent earneſt Letters, and one or more meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, to the Elders of theſe Churches here for ſome of our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters to break the Bread of Life to them. The Elders here ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Counſell of God, and one of another, wee borrowed two of the Paſtors of our Churches, (Mr. <hi>Knolles</hi> of <hi>Watertowne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Thomſon</hi> of <hi>Braintree,</hi> the Churches being either of them ſupplyed with two Miniſters apeece) and ſent them forth ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnely in the Name of the Lord to that work; who as they went along took with them one Mr. <hi>James,</hi> a Miniſter (though then out of employment) from <hi>New-Haven,</hi> to the fellowſhip of that work. And for their better incouragement, our Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour here wrote a Letter to the Governour of <hi>Virginia</hi> to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him, and his Aſſiſtants, with the occaſion and end of their comming, and expreſſed withall his deſire of their Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian entertainment for a time, and peaceable returne, if they found any inconvenience by their comming. What entertaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they found from the major part of the Government there, I forbeare to ſpeak. The bloody Maſſacre, which ſoon after their diſmiſſion, the <hi>Indians</hi> in thoſe parts executed upon the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> cried aloud from heaven, that after a white Horſe, God is wont to ſend forth a red, <hi>Rev.</hi> 6.2, 3, 4. But nevertheleſſe, God ſo farre forth followed their labours with his bleſſing in the work of converſion, that ſundry of them were effectually
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:124282:45"/> wrought upon by the power of the Lord Jeſus; whereof ſome of them came along with our Miniſters at their returne, and are received into our Churches: others of them who could not ſo well diſpoſe of their affaires there, joyned with one Mr. <hi>Harri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> a Miniſter there, (who was alſo mightily ſtirred up by our Miniſters comming:) and they with him have ſince given up themſelves to more holy communion and converſation before the Lord.</p>
                  <p>Others of the Weſterne Iſlands (as <hi>Barbadas, Antegua, Mevis</hi>) have deſired the like helpe from us: but the departure of ſome of our Miniſters ſince, (one to Heaven, others to <hi>England</hi>) have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto detained us from opportunity to afford unto them the like ſuccour for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>I will not ſpeak, what opportunity of reaching forth a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to the <hi>Indians</hi> in this kind, God hath lately begun to open us a door of: in that divers of their <hi>Sachims,</hi> and <hi>Sagamores</hi> (as they call them, to wit, their Governors) have ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the government of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and have willingly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected themſelves to the acceptance of the Ten Commandements, though ſome of them, doe moſt ſtick at the ſeventh Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, as it forbiddeth Polygamy. Nevertheleſſe otherwiſe they willingly conſent to abandon Adultery and Fornication, and unnaturall luſts.</p>
                  <p>But though the <hi>Indians</hi> have been ſlow to learne our language, eſpecially in matters of Religion (howſoever in Trading they ſoon underſtood us:) yet wee have often offered to bring up their <hi>Indian</hi> children in our Schooles, that they might learne to ſpeake to their Countreymen in their own language. But be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that might prove long, one of our Elders (Mr. <hi>Eliot,</hi> the Teacher of the Church of <hi>Rocksbury</hi>) hath (with the conſent of the Natives) preached to them firſt by an Interpreter, but ſince having with much induſtry learned their language, hee now preacheth to two Congregations of them in their own language weekly. One week on the fourth day to one Congregation, who ſit down neer to <hi>Dorcheſter Mill,</hi> and another week, on the ſixth day, to another Congregation of them, who ſit down in <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge,</hi> neer <hi>Watertown Mill.</hi> To eaſe and encourage him in his work, the Miniſters of neighbour Churches take off by turnes his weekly Lecture on the third day. The fruit hitherto hath been, the <hi>Indians</hi> reſort more and more to theſe Aſſemblies,
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:124282:46"/> heare with reverence and attention, reforme (and make Lawes amongſt themſelves, for reformation of) ſundry abuſes, aske ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry queſtions for their inſtruction, and among the reſt, an old Counſellor of one of their <hi>Sagamores</hi> enquired, if it might bee poſſible that our God, and our Chriſt ſhould accept an old ſinner ſuch as himſelfe? Mr. <hi>Eliot</hi> anſwered him, <q rend="margQuotes">yes, there was hope, becauſe hee never had the meanes of the knowledge of God offered to him before. And our Saviour Chriſt did ſometimes call into his Vineyard ſome to doe him ſervice, even in the laſt houre of the day, in the laſt part of their lives. And the old <hi>Indian</hi> being demanded if hee underſtood this?</q> Hee an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, yea, ſaith he, I underſtand it, and beleeve it.</p>
                  <p>It is true, there may be doubt that for a time there will bee no great hope of any Nationall converſion, till Antichriſt be ruined, and the Jewes converted; becauſe the Church (or Temple) of God, is ſaid to bee filled with ſmoak, till the ſeven plagues (which are to be poured upon the Antichriſtian ſtate) be fulfilled: And till then, no man (that is, no conſiderable number of men out of the Church, as Pagans be) ſhall be able to enter into the Church, <hi>Rev.</hi> 15.8. yet nevertheleſſe, that hindreth not, but that ſome ſprinklings, &amp; gleanings of them may be brought home to Chriſt, as now and then ſome Proſelytes were brought into the fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Church of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when there was a greater partiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wall ſet up between Jewes and Gentiles, then now there is between Chriſtians and Pagans. And the Lord ſhine upon them in mercy, in bleſſing the meanes of his Grace to them in the Lord Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>The proof that none of us ſeeme to have minded the work of converſion, Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> alledgeth out of the Book intituled Plain dealing, which ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">There hath not been ſent forth any, by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Church, to learn the Natives-Language, or to inſtruct them in our Religion firſt, becauſe they ſay they have not to do with them being without, except they come to hear and learne En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh.</q>
                  </p>

                     <hi>An.</hi> 1. What if there have not bin any ſent forth by any Church to learn the <hi>Indians</hi> language? That will not argue our neglect of minding the work of their converſion. For there be of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> that live amongſt us, and dayly reſort to us; and ſome of them learne our language; and ſome of us learn theirs.

And of late, the Word (as I have ſaid) is publickly preached unto them in two ſeverall <hi>Indian</hi> Congregations, though wee never thought it fit to ſend any of our Engliſh to live amongſt them, to learn their language: for who ſhould teach them?</p>

                  <p>I know not whether ever any gave him ſo weake an account or no: If any ſo did, it was his raſhneſſe, or ignorance both of us, and the truth.

                  <p>But Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> acknowledgeth Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his endeavours in this kind, but doth thereby the more aggravate our corrupt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and practiſe, who have neglected ſo great an opportunity as to proſecute his courſe. Onely Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> (ſaith hee) did aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay,</p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">what could be done with thoſe deſolate ſoules, and by little experience quickly found a wonderfull great facility to gain thouſands of them to ſo much and more Chriſtianity both in profeſſion and practice, then in the moſt of our people doth appeare.
<p>But the unhappineſſe of theſe principles whereof wee ſpeak, did keep him (as hee profeſſeth) from making uſe of that great opportunity, and large doore, which the Lord there hath opened to all who will bee zealous of propagating the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpell.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his ſpeech of the wonderfull great facility hee had of gaining ſo farre upon the <hi>Indians,</hi> be not too too prodigally hyperbolicall (as I much fear it is) I thinke his ſinne is ſo much the greater before the Lord, that he did neglect to take the opportunitie of preaching to them the Word of the Lord, that they might have been brought on, not onely to an Antichriſtian converſion (ſuch as hee maketh the converſion of the common ſort of Chriſtians in Proteſtant Churches:) but to a ſincere converſion unto Chriſt Jeſus. But I confeſſe with Mr.
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:124282:47"/> 
                     <hi>Baylie,</hi> his own corrupt Principles, (his own I ſay, not ours) it ſeemeth have detained him from putting forth his hand to the Lords Plough in ſo large a Field. For if hee look (as it ſeemeth) for new Apoſtles to be ſent immediately from Chriſt for ſuch a work: or if hee think, no Church is, or will be extant upon the face of the earth, till Antichriſt bee aboliſhed out of the world, theſe and ſuch like principles are enough, not onely to retard him from the planting of Churches amongſt <hi>Indians,</hi> but alſo to further him in ſupplanting all the Churches of Chriſt in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendome.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. I ſaid not without cauſe, that I feared Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> his teſtimony of the facility of ſuch a converſion of the <hi>Indians</hi> was too hyperbolicall. For I received advertiſement from Mr. <hi>James</hi> (one of the Miniſters, who went to <hi>Virginia</hi> upon the Lords worke, of which I ſpake before) that whilſt he was detai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned (by winds) in <hi>Mary-land</hi> (a Popiſh Plantation between us and <hi>Virginia</hi>) he ſaw, as I remember, (for his Letter is not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at hand with me) 40. <hi>Indians</hi> baptized in new Shirts, which the Catholicks had given them for their incouragement unto Baptiſme. But he tarried there ſo long for a faire winde, that before his departure, he ſaw the <hi>Indians</hi> (when their ſhirts were foule, and they knew not how to waſh them) come againe to make a new motion, either the Catholick <hi>Engliſh</hi> there muſt give them new Shirts, or elſe they would renounce their Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme. I doubt, the <hi>Indians</hi> about Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> are not of a much better ſpirit. I might mention a fairer inſtance in theſe parts, yet ſuch as may argue what kind of facility there is in the <hi>Indians</hi> to converſion, ſo much as to outward profeſſion. At our firſt comming hither, <hi>John Sagamore</hi> was the chiefeſt <hi>Sachim</hi> in theſe parts. He falling ſick, our Paſtor Mr. <hi>Wilſon</hi> hearing of it (and being of ſome acquaintance with him) went to viſit him, taking one of the Deacons of our Church with him, and withall, a little Mithridate, and ſtrong water. When he came to his lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (which they call a <hi>Wigwam</hi>) hearing a noyſe within, hee looked over the Mat of the door to diſcerne what it meant, and ſaw many <hi>Indians</hi> gathered together, and ſome <hi>Powwaws</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them, who are their Prieſts, Phyſitians, and Witches. They by courſe ſpake earneſtly to the ſick <hi>Sagamore,</hi> and to his diſeaſe, (in a way of charming of it and him) and one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in a kind of Antiphonies. When they had done, all kept
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:124282:47"/> ſilence, our Paſtour went in with the Deacon, and found the man farre ſpent, his eyes ſet in his head, hee ſpeech leaving him, his mother (old <hi>Squaw-Sachim</hi>) ſitting weeping at his beds head, Well (ſaith our Paſtour) our God ſave <hi>Sagamore John, Powwaw Cram</hi> (that is, kill) <hi>Sagamore John:</hi> And thereupon hee fell to prayer with his Deacon, and after Prayer, forced into the ſick mans mouth with a Spoon, a little Mithridate diſſolved in the ſtrong water; ſoon after the <hi>Sagamore</hi> looked up, and three dayes after went abroad on hunting. This providence ſo farre prevailed with the <hi>Sagamore,</hi> that he promiſed to look after the <hi>Engliſh</hi> mans God, to heare their Sermons, to weare <hi>Engliſh</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parell, &amp;c. But his neighbour <hi>Indians Sagamores,</hi> and <hi>Powwaws</hi> hearing of this, threatned to <hi>Cram</hi> him (that is, to kill him) if he did ſo degenerate from his Countrey Gods, and Religion, he thereupon fell off, and took up his <hi>Indian</hi> courſe of life again. Whatſoever facility may ſeeme to offer it ſelfe of the converſion of the <hi>Indians,</hi> it is not ſo eaſie a matter for them to hold out, no not in a ſemblance of profeſſion of the true Religion. After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God ſtruck <hi>John Sagamore</hi> againe, (and as I remember with the ſmall Pox:) but then when they deſired like ſuccour from our Paſtour, as before, he told them, now the Lord was angry with <hi>Sagamore John,</hi> and it was doubtfull, hee would not ſo eaſily be intreated. The <hi>Sagamore</hi> blamed himſelf and juſtified God, and confeſſed, he ſhould not have been diſcouraged by their threats from ſeeking our God: For thoſe <hi>Sagamores</hi> and <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waws</hi> who did moſt terrifie him, hee had ſeene God ſweeping them away by death, before himſelf, in a ſhort time after. And therefore when hee ſaw hee muſt die (for hee died of that ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe) hee left his ſonne to the education of our Paſtor, that he might keep cloſer to the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and to their God, then him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf had done. But his ſonne alſo dyed of the ſame diſeaſe ſoon after. All which I relate, to ſhew, that though a forme of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion may be profeſſed amongſt Chriſtians with ſome facility: yet it is not ſo eaſie a matter to gaine theſe Pagan <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſo much as to a forme of our Religion, and to hold it, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> did promiſe himſelf greater poſſibilities.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> ſhall do well to conſider, that Mr. <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> his ſpeech doth not ſo much hold forth the facility of the <hi>Indians</hi> to any ſuch converſion, as might fit them for Church-eſtate, but rather the Hypocriſie and Formalitie of the ordinary
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:124282:48"/> Church-Members of Nationall Churches; which he profeſſeth is ſo far off from true converſion, <q rend="margQuotes">that it is the ſubverſion of the ſoules of many Millions in Chriſtendome, from one falſe worſhip to another.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. It is no unhappineſſe of any principle of ours, <q rend="margQuotes"> that hath kept Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> from making uſe of his great opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and open door, to propagate the Goſpell amongſt the <hi>Indians.</hi>
                     </q> For though their facility to ſuch a carnall converſion, as hee deſcribeth, gave him no juſt warrant, to gather them into a Church-eſtate: yet it was a juſt encouragement to provoke him (who underſtood their Language) to have preached the Word of God unto them, which might have been mighty through God (if ſincerely diſpenſed) to have turned them from darkneſſe to light, from the power of Satan unto God, and ſo have prepared them, both for Church-fellowſhip here, and for heaven hereafter.</p>
                  <p>But if Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> conceive that either Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> or elſe wee were to be blamed, becauſe we doe not preſently receive <hi>Indians</hi> into the Fellowſhip of our Churches, ſeeing their facility to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form their outward man to us, and to ſo much of our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> mentioneth: hee ſhall doe well to conſider before hand, whether <hi>Jacobs</hi> children did wel, to perſwade the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chemites, (Gen.</hi> 34.) to receive circumciſion, before they better un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood the Covenant of <hi>Abraham,</hi> (to which circumciſion was a Seale) and had made ſome better profeſſion of taking hold of it.</p>

                     <hi>SECT. 19.</hi> Tending to rectifie ſome miſtakes of <hi>Mr.</hi> Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lie in relating the former abſurdities.</head>
                  <p>But before I leave this cloſe of Mr. <hi>Baylies</hi> third Chapter, touching the evill fruits of Independency, let mee advertiſe him of ſome few further miſtakes in his Narration of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, when he reckoneth in the front of vile errours, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitation of the perſon of the Spirit in all the godly, let him weigh what hath been ſaid above, touching that point. And if hee cleare it to be an errour, I willingly ſhall acknowledge, hee ſhall teach me that, which I yet know not. I profeſſe my ſelf willing to learn of a meaner man, then Mr. <hi>Baylie.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">Secondly, when he maketh the number of the erring per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons incredible, almoſt no ſociety, no family free from that peſt, <hi>Boſton</hi> it ſelf ſo farre infected, that few there were untainted:</q> let him be pleaſed to conſider, whether his teſtimony will make it good. His teſtimonies (recited in his Markes <hi>F F. G G.</hi>) ſpeak to the utmoſt of truth, but not ſo much as he avoucheth. The ſhort Story in Preface, <hi>pag.</hi> 7. ſaith indeed, <q rend="margQuotes">They had ſome of all ſorts and qualities in all places to patronize and defend them: and almoſt in every family ſome were ready to defend them as the Apple of their own eye.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But this will not make it good, that almoſt in every family ſome were infected with the peſt of their errours. It is one thing to ſpeak in the defence of erroneous perſons, another to ſpeak in defence of errours. Multitudes there were, that thought well of the perſons, who knew nothing of their errours, but heard onely of their unbottoming ſandy foundations of a ſpirituall eſtate, which hath been mentioned above, Chap. 3.</p>
                  <p>Which may alſo truely be ſaid even of <hi>Boſton</hi> likewiſe. The body of the Church, the greateſt part of them were like thoſe members of the Church in <hi>Thyatira,</hi> of whom it is ſaid (<hi>Rev.</hi> 2.24.) They knew not the depths of Satan. The truth whereof may evidently appeare by this, That when thoſe errors of Miſtris <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> were publickly charged upon her before the Church, and proved by ſufficient witneſſes, the whole body of the Church, and all the Brethren with one accord (ſave onely her ſonne) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:124282:51"/> readily to her cenſure: which they would not have done,</p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">if the whole Church of <hi>Boſton</hi> (ſome excepted) had become her converts, and were infected with her opinions.
<p>Thirdly, when hee ſaith, they adored ſome of their Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, and inſtanceth in Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Whelewright.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </q>
                  <p>Adoration is too vaſt an Hyperbole to be made good by juſt teſtimonies. All hyperbolicall praiſes, though they may farre exceed the bounds of truth in compariſons of men with men; yet they will not reach adoration, which is divine worſhip. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther will it bee made good, That they magnified either Mr. <hi>Whelewright,</hi> or me, for the defence of their errors. Yea they ſoon forſooke Mr. <hi>Whelewright</hi> (as well as he them) when they ſaw his judgement (as well as mine) againſt Antinomianiſme, and Familiſme.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, when he ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">Miſtris <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> and the late Governour, kept almoſt every day, ſo private and long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> that made them conclude all was their own.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>I muſt needs profeſſe, that cannot be made good by any wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of truth, Miſtris <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> ſeldome reſorted to mee: and when ſhe did, ſhe did ſeldome or never enter into any private ſpeech between the former Governour and my ſelf. And when ſhe did come to me, it was ſeldome or never (that I can tell of) that ſhe tarried long. I rather think, ſhe was loath to reſort much to me, or, to conferre long with me, leſt ſhe might ſeeme to learne ſomewhat from me. And withall I know (by good proof) ſhe was very carefull to prevent any jealouſie in mee, that ſhee ſhould harbour any private opinions, differing from the courſe of my publick Miniſtery. <q rend="margQuotes">Which ſhe could not well have avoyded, if ſhe had kept almoſt every day ſo private and long diſcourſe with me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But what Teſtimony, or proof doth Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> alledge for this our private and long conference, almoſt every day? His marke <hi>[Y Y]</hi> referreth us to the ſhort ſtory, where it is ſaid, <q rend="margQuotes">They made full account the day had been theirs.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>But did they make this account upon occaſion of theſe our private, and long, and frequent conferences every day? not a ſyllable of proofe for this point. It is not righteous dealing, large charges, and narrow proofs.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, that which Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> further relateth from the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:124282:51"/> teſtimony of Mr. <hi>Williams,</hi> is as farre from truth, as the former.</p>
                  <p>
                     <q rend="margQuotes">Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> (ſaith Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi>) told me, that he was employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to buy from the Savages, for their late Governour, and Mr. <hi>Cotton,</hi> with their Followers, a portion of Land with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Plantation whither they might retire and live according to their mind, exempt from the juriſdiction of all others, whether Civill or Eccleſiaſtick, Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> was in ſo great friendſhip with the late Governour, when he told me ſo much, that I beleeve he would have been loth to haveſpoken an untruth of him.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> But this I dare be bold to ſay, if Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> told Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> ſo much, that he was imployed by me to buy any Land from the Savages, for mee and my followers (as he calls them) he ſpake an untruth of me, whatſoever he did of the Governour. Yet becauſe I would not ſpeake nor thinke worſe of Mr. of <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams</hi> then neceſſitie conſtrayneth, I cannot ſay but that he might ſpeak as he thought, and as he was told; for it may well bee, that ſuch as abuſed the Governours name to him for ſuch an end, might alſo more boldly abuſe mine. But I muſt profeſſe, I nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wrote, nor ſpake, nor ſent to Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> for any ſuch er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand. If ever I had removed, I intended <hi>Quinipyack,</hi> and not <hi>Aquethnick.</hi> And I can hardly beleeve the Governour would ſend to him for any ſuch end, who I ſuppoſe never thought it likely, that himſelf ſhould tarry longer in the Countrey, then he tarried in the <hi>Bay.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Fiftly, when Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> objecteth the prophaneneſſe of theſe erroneous perſons, and juſtifieth it by the teſtimonies of Mr. <hi>Weld</hi> and my ſelf, <q rend="margQuotes">And aggravateth the ſame by their profeſſion of Piety (ſo farre, that they avow their ſtanding loofe from all reformed Churches as uncleane, becauſe of their mixture with the prophane Multitude.)</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let him be pleaſed to conſider; Firſt, what was ſaid above, <hi>Non ſcelus, ſed ſceleris impunitas,</hi> is the guilt of a ſociety, whether ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vill or ſacred.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, what Mr. <hi>Weld</hi> meant by fouler ſinnes then pride, or lying, found in thoſe perſons, I cannot gueſſe: nor have I heard of them: unleſſe hee meant the adultery of one, who upon his own confeſſion was caſt out of the Church for that crime.</p>
                  <p>As for the teſtimony of mine, which hee quoteth from ſome

                     <pb n="90" facs="tcp:124282:53"/> words in the vialls, wherein the ſinnes of the people were repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, let him not improve them further then they will bear. Such reproofs doe not alwayes argue ſinnes of our Church members: or if they did, yet not, that thoſe ſinnes are openly known: or if openly known, yet not, that they were tolerated. And yet all theſe muſt concurre, or elſe the vices found amongſt profeſſors, will not argue the viciouſneſſe either of their doctrine or wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or Church Government.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luther</hi> complaineth, <hi>in Poſtill. ſuper Evangel. Dom. adventus, Sunt nunc homines magis vindictae cupidi, magis avari, magis ab omni miſericordiâ remoti, magis immodeſti, &amp; indiſciplinati, multoque de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriores, quam fuerunt ſub papatu.</hi> And <hi>Chryſoſtome, (in opere imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. in Matth. Hom.</hi> 49.) ſpeaketh of Chriſtians as becomming like the Hereticks, or Pagans, or worſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet I ſuppoſe he that ſhould improve the words either of <hi>Chryſoſtome,</hi> to argue the diſcipline of Chriſtians, worſe then that of the Pagans: or of <hi>Luther,</hi> to argue the diſcipline of Proteſtants to be worſe then that of Papiſts, he ſhall doubtleſſe ſtretch their words upon the Rack, farre beyond the ſcope of their meaning. The words I ſpake, were in compariſon between the godly Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors in <hi>England,</hi> and ours here, and at ſuch a time, when Epiſcopall perſecution made them draw the nearer to God, and to walke the more circumſpectly before men. But Sheepe ſet at libertie from the feare of Wolves, will ſtraggle further from their Shepheard, then when they reſent danger.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, it is too groſſe and heavy an aggravation, which Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> putteth upon us, if he meane it of us, <q rend="margQuotes">That our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of pietie is ſo faire that wee ſtand alooſe from all refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Churches as uncleane, becauſe of their mixture with the prophane multitude.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>For it is more then he can prove, or we doe profeſſe. Though in the Biſhops time, we did not forthwith receive all the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church of <hi>England</hi> into the fellowſhip of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches: yet (for ought I know) wee are not likely to ſtand alooſe from Presbyteriall Churches faithfully adminiſtred, nor from the teſtimony which they ſhall give of their members, that may have occaſion to Traffick hither. And the like doe I conceive of other reformed Churches in other Nations of Chriſtendome. Presbyterian Churches faithfully adminiſtred, are not wont to admit a mixt prophane multitude to the Lords Table.</p>
                  <pb n="91" facs="tcp:124282:53"/>
                  <p>Sixtly, let me take off one inſtance more, which Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth of one abomination, which to him ſeemeth ſtrange. <q rend="margQuotes">That the Midwives to our moſt zealous women, ſhould not onely have familiarity with the Devill, but alſo in that ſervice com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit devilliſh Malefices: which ſo farre as they tell us, were not onely paſt over without puniſhment, but never ſo much as en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired after.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This accuſation is indeed of ſome weight, becauſe it is of a grievous, and devilliſh crime, and it tolerated. But how doth it appeare to him, that it was tolerated? <q rend="margQuotes">not onely paſt over without puniſhment, but never ſo much as enquired after?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Why, ſaith he, ſo farre as they tell us. So farre as they tell us? is the ſilence of a ſhort ſtory of this or that fact, a good argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, <hi>a non dici, ad non eſſe?</hi> yea it is a good argument on the contrary, that there was inquiry made after that Midwife, and diligent ſearch into her, or elſe it would have been recorded, as ſome cloſe conveyance of the erroneous party. The truth is, the woman, though ſhe offered her ſelf to the Elders of our Church, yet was not received, upon diſcovery of ſome unſound principles in her judgement. Being then no member, the Church had no power to deale with her. But when ſuſpition grew of her fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity with the Devill, eſpecially upon that occaſion, which the ſhort ſtory relateth, ſhee was convented before the Magiſtrates, and diligently examined about that, and other evills. But though no familiarity with the Devill could be proved againſt her; yet becauſe of ſome other offences in dealing with young women, ſhe was forbidden to ſtay in the Countrey.</p>

                  <p>Having thus given account to Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> of the inconſequence of all his diſcourſe from the errors of this countrey, to argue the unſoundneſſe of our Church-diſcipline, let me now intreat him to conſider, what better fruits might have been expected in the like caſe from Presbyteriall Government. I demand, if Presby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terian Government had been eſtab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:124282:54"/> not then have received all theſe Hereticks, and erroneous perſons, into our Church? Yes ſurely, for no member of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth is excluded: well, therein our Congregationall diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline bringeth forth no worſe fruit, then their Presbyterian.</p>
                  <p>I demand againe, if theſe perſons ſhould afterwards fall into error, or Hereſie, which could not be proved by two witneſſes, what courſe would Presbyterian government have taken? would it not have forborne proceſſe, till ſufficient teſtimony might bee brought to convince them? If ſuſpicion of their unſound judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had grown, would they not have examined them, and if they denied it, and no ſufficient teſtimony could bee brought againſt them, would not the Presbyters have let them alone? Hitherto we did the ſame.</p>
                  <p>I demand further, if any Presbytery in a Church, were ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted to be too remiſſe in proceeding againſt ſuch Delinquents, would not the Presbytery of the neighbour Churches have taken the matter in hand, and ſo gathering into a Synod, firſt convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſuch errors, and then condemned them, and the maintainers of them too, if they were found guiltie of them, and perſiſtent in them? Thus farre alſo the Presbytery of our neighbour Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches did proceed as to gather into a Synod, and both convinced and condemned the errors. And though they did not proceed to condemne or cenſure the maintainers of them; yet when they had gotten proof thereof, they proceeded in their own congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations to the cenſure of their own erroneous members (after all other meanes to recover them uſed in vaine:) And beſides, they dealt with the Presbytery of our Church to doe the ſame. And wee hearing their complaints and their proofs, wee reſpectively hearkned to them, and proceeded to the like cenſure in our Church, as they had done in theirs; And in like ſort travelled with our members for their conviction, as they had done with theirs, even ſo farre, that Miſtris <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> was brought to a recantation, though her prevarication of it brought her to a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, yea the utmoſt cenſure, and that with generall conſent of our whole Church, and ſatisfaction of others. It ſeemeth then, that our Independency (as it is called) doth no more breed, nor nouriſh, nor tolerate errors, or Hereſies, then Presbyterian di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcipline doth. And if there ſhould a defect ariſe in any Church, there is the like remedy in the vigilancy of other Churches, and finally, obſtinacy in all evills of notorious offence, whether in
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:124282:54"/> judgement or practiſe, meeteth at length with the ſame or like cenſure, in either government.</p>
                  <p>Let not therefore Mr. <hi>Baylie</hi> allow himſelf in ſaying as he doth (in the cloſe of his third Chapter) <q rend="margQuotes">That this new and ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar way, the Lord hath ſo manifeſtly curſed with more bad fruits, and greater ſtore of them, then ever yet did appeare upon the tree of Browniſme.</q> For though it becommeth not us to make compariſons of fruits with other Churches (unleſſe themſelves did provoke us to it:) nor doth it concern us to deale with them about any offence, unleſſe we dwelt neer them, and knew their eſtate:) yet this is enough to us, to cleare us unto Mr. <hi>Baylie,</hi> and to the world, againſt all his exceptions, That (through the mercy of Chriſt) no evill fruit at all hath ſprung from our Church Government. What offence ſoever, in judgement or pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe, hath been ſuſpected or found among us, it hath not ſprung from the government, but from perſonall defects, either among the Brethren or Elders.

                  <p>Give me therefore leave to profeſſe freely without offence, what I truely beleeve without ſcruple, that though the Acts of Church-government (in the ordination of officers, and cenſure of offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders) by the Presbyters of neighbour Churches, be very antient: yet not more antient then <hi>Huma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I will not here ſpeak of thoſe Texts of Scripture (<hi>Matth.</hi> 18.15, 16, 17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.) which convince us, that Congregationall diſcipline was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by Chriſt, and his Apoſtles. I refer them to the ſequele, wherein our particular Tenents are diſcuſſed by Mr. <hi>Baylie,</hi> which will come in due place (God willing) to be reviewed and exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. But,</p>
                  <p>In the firſt century, whilſt the Apoſtles lived, wee read of no act of Church-power put forth by the Elders of Churches over abſent Congregations, but onely in <hi>Act.</hi> 15.28. with Chap. 16.4. But let it be conſidered:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That this Synod was not <hi>Status Conventus,</hi> a ſet monethly, or yeerly Aſſembly, the ordinary ſtanding Judicatory of the Church: nor aſſembled for adminiſtration of ordinary Church-power (as ordination of Officers, or cenſure of offenders) but called together upon urgent, and unwonted occaſion, the diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of <hi>Antioch,</hi> which both craved, and needed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection in ſuch a caſe, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.1.2. And wee eaſily grant (what we willingly practiſe in a Congregationall way) that neither do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine, nor diſcipline can well proceed unto publick Edification, when the Church is rent with diſſention. The promiſe of Chriſts preſence with his Church, is given to them met in his name, and agreeing in his Name, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.18, 19. But when a Congregation wanteth agreement and peace amongſt themſelves, it is then a way of God (according to the patterne, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.2.) to conſult with ſome other Church, or Churches, either by themſelves or their meſſengers met in a Synod. But then they ſend not to them for power to adminiſter any ordinance amongſt themſelves, but for light to ſatisfie diſſenters, and ſo to remove the ſtumbling block of

And then the diſſention of this Church from others hindering the free paſſage of the Goſpell (as much as diſſention amongſt themſelves doth) it may give juſt and neceſſary occaſion of aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling a Synod of the Elders, and meſſengers of Neighbor-Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches for the conviction of their ſin with common conſent, and if (after long patience) they remain obſtinate, to withdraw from them the right hand of Fellowſhip in the communion of Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches.</p>

And this was more then an aſſiſtance, even a guidance.

He ſaith <q rend="margQuotes">The Power of the Keys is given to the Church, to <hi>Peter,</hi> not as an Apoſtle, nor as an Elder, but as a profeſt Believer, in the name of Believers.

If there had been ſome difference between the <hi>Way</hi> and the <hi>Keyes</hi> in ſome expreſſions: yet (as the Praefacers related from a Letter of mine to a friend of theirs:) it lay rather in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gical Termes, then in Doctrine of Divinity, or Church-Practiſe: And ſuch, amongſt others, is this very point in hand. If there ſeem to be any difference in the expreſſion of the one Treatiſe, or of the other, about this point, it is in the firſt Subject of the Power of the <hi>Keys</hi> (which is a Logical Notion:) but the point is the ſame, both in Doctrine of Divinity, and in Church-practiſe.</p>
               <p>As for the imputation of Inconſtancy, which the <hi>Avenger</hi> is pleaſed to put upon me, <q rend="margQuotes">He hath heard that I have often alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my Judgement ſince I went to New-England:</q> I ſhould thank him if he would tell me either wherein I have altered my Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or from whom he ſo heard: Mean while, he may do well to remember, That a Citizen of <hi>Zion</hi> (a pure member of a pure Church) taketh not up <hi>a Reproach againſt his Neighbour.</hi> Pſal. 15.3. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> was ſurmiſed by ſome to be a <hi>Reed ſhaken with the wind;</hi> but it was a windy Fancy.</p>

It is not a more improbable ſenſe of our Saviours words, to underſtand the Kingdom of Heaven (<hi>Matth.</hi> 16.19.) of a Particular Viſible Church, rather then of the Catholick Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church. For I do not read that the Scripture doth any where acknowledge a Catholick Viſible Church at all. The Catholick Church is not Viſible as a Church: and the Church that is Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, is not Catholick.

For though the whole Church (or which is all one, the Catholick Church) may be Viſible in her ſingular Members; yet ſo they are not a Church. Or though it
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:124282:63"/> may be Viſible in the ſeveral Particular Congregations, yet none of them is Catholick. Or though all of them together may be called a Catholick Church, or General Aſſembly, if they were met together; Yet I ſuppoſe, <hi>Vindex</hi> would be loth to ſay, That Chriſt giveth the Power of the Keyes (all Eccleſiaſtical Power) into their hands. Such general Aſſemblies are rare and extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; and extraordinary Aſſemblies are not fit Judicatories to hear and cenſure ordinary offences, or to adminiſter the ordinary Acts of Church-Power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. He therefore diſtruſting (as it ſeemeth) that to be the meaning of our Saviours words (to underſtand the Kingdom of Heaven of the Catholick Viſible Church) He expoundeth it rather to be meant of the Inviſible Myſtical Church. And indeed, true it is, that <hi>Peter</hi> and other Preachers of the Goſpel have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived ſuch a Power of the Keys, as by the Miniſtery of the Word, to beget Faith in their Hearers, and ſo to open to them a dore into the Inviſible Church: as alſo to convince unbelievers of their damnable Eſtate, and ſo Miniſterially to declare them ſhut out from the fellowſhip of the Inviſible Church. But there is alſo a Power of the Keyes, to open a dore unto profeſt Believers into the Viſible Church: and again to ſhut them out of the Viſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Church, when they grow ſcandalous. And therefore the Viſible Church cannot be excluded from one part of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Kingdom of Heaven, whereof <hi>Peter</hi> received the Keyes.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, certain it is, that when by the power of the Keyes, a Believer is received into the Inviſible Church, he can never be ſhut again out of that Church. But the Keyes here given to <hi>Peter,</hi> have a Power to ſhut out of the Kingdom of heaven, even the ſame Perſons, unto whom they have opened the dore before. And therefore the Kingdom of Heaven (whereof <hi>Peter</hi> received the Keyes) is not meant onely of the Inviſible Church, but of the Viſible Church alſo,</p>

Nor can it be doubted, that if there muſt be a vocation to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter theſe, there muſt be alſo ſome, who have power from Chriſt to give ſuch a vocation.</p>
                  <p>Albeit, If it had been of any weight for the expediting of any controverſie about the Keyes (which I know none:) I might eaſily have given ſome definition of the Keyes; as to ſay, The Keyes of the Kingdom of Heaven are ſpiritual Powers given by
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:124282:67"/> Chriſt to his Church to diſpenſe the Treaſures of his Kingdom, for the opening and ſhuting, binding and looſing the ſpiritual E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates of men in the Church. By ſpiritual Powers, I mean ſpiritual callings, and ſpiritual gifts fitting for them, enabling to ſome ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Acts: By the treaſures of the Kingdom I mean the Word, Seals, and Cenſures, and the ſpiritual bleſſings laid up in them. But Callings, Gifts, and Treaſures, are all of them Ordinances. The other parts of the Definition, what be the Acts, and Ends, Objects, and Subjects of this power, I opened formerly in the third, fourth, and fifth Paragraphs of the firſt chapter of the <hi>Keyes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But upon what I expreſſed in this Paragraph, <hi>Vindex</hi> is pleaſed to animadvert ſome things.</p>

                     <hi>Anſw. Vindex</hi> doth cleerly miſtake my ſcope and meaning, to think I did lay down the ſtate of the Queſtion in this Paragraph. For I think it is no Queſtion at all, That the Keyes of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven, are the Ordinances of Chriſt, which he hath in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted to be adminiſtred in his Church. Neither is it the ſcope of my whole Book, to give the people a ſhare in the Government of the Church: Nay, it is not the ſcope of the greater part of the Book: Nay further, there be that blame the Book for the other Extreme, That it placeth the Government of the Church not at all in the hands of the People, but of the Presbyterie.

                     <q rend="margQuotes">But ſaith <hi>Vindex,</hi> it ſoundeth ill at firſt hearing, to ſay, that the People haue any power to exerciſe Ordinances, of Preaching, or adminiſtring the Seals or Cenſures.

Yea, (you will ſay) but private men may beſtow their Gifts privately. But election of Officers is a publike Gift, whatſoever elſe beſide; and that muſt be diſpenſed publikely; and that not as Lords, to elect whom they liſt, but as Stewards and Miniſters to Chriſt, to elect whom the Lord hath choſen.</p>
                  <q rend="margQuotes">I ſaid indeed (in that Paragraph) That Chriſt in giving the Keyes, inveſteth thoſe to whom he giveth them, with a power to, open and ſhut the Gates both of the Church and Heaven; and that this power lieth partly in their ſpiritual calling (whether it be their Office, or their Place, and Order in the Church) and partly in the concourſe and co-operation of Chriſt, accompany<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the right diſpenſation of thoſe Keyes or Ordinances.

For that which is expreſſed in the Protaſis of the Apoſtles compariſon, is implyed in the reddition; <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.4, 5. As we have many Members in one Body, and all Members have not the ſame office: ſo we being ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, are one Body in Chriſt, &amp;c.

<pb n="20" facs="tcp:124282:70"/> of the holy Ordinances of God to publike edification.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Vpon this Propoſition M. <hi>Rutterford</hi> (as he excelleth in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutenes and Scholaſtical Argumentativenes) hath raiſed four Queſtions, though ſome of them more then I did intend to point at in the Propoſition. Let us conſider of them in their order, not with a ſpirit of contention (which himſelf in his Epiſtle to the Reader, candidly profeſſeth againſt) but with a ſpirit ſtudious of Truth and Peace.</p>
                  <p>The firſt Queſtion he raiſeth from that Propoſition, is this: <q rend="margQuotes">Whether a company of Believers and Saints, builded by Faith upon the Rock Christ, and united in a Church-Covenant, be the onely inſtituted Viſible Church of the New-Teſtament, to the which Christ hath given the Keys?</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Himſelf underſtandeth the Propoſition, as if it held forth the Affirmative. But in very Truth, as the word [onely] is not in the Propoſition: ſo it was far from my intendment, to exclude an Organical Church (a Church furniſhed with all her officers) from being an inſtituted Viſible Church of the New Teſtament, as well as <hi>Coetus Fidelium,</hi> a company of Chriſtians without Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. When the Propoſition ſpeaketh of Officers as given to the Church, it intendeth them not as meer adjuncts given to a Subject, but as Integral parts given to the whole Body of the Church, for completing the integrity and perfection of it. And ſo much the very words of the Propoſition do imply; <q rend="margQuotes"> for it ſpeaketh of ſuch a Church, to whom Chriſt hath given the adminiſtration of all his publike Worſhip and Ordinances: which is not a power given to a Church of private Believers, deſtitute of Officers.</q> Howſoever they may be capable (more or leſs) of ſome ſpiritual Adminiſtrations: yet doubtles they are not capable of all: and for inſtance, not of the adminiſtration of Sacraments, without Officers.</p>
                  <p>Neither was it my intendment in that Propoſition, to exclude lawful Synods (gathered, and proceeding according to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern, Acts 15.) from all participation in ſome part of the power of the Keyes. For they have a power to decide controverſies from the Word, and to appoint a courſe for the preventing and healing of offences, and for agreement in the Truth according to the Word. But theſe Synods are not the ordinary ſtanding Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicatories of the Church: neither do they convene, nor exerciſe their directive Power, but when the particular Churches lie under variance or offence; or are not yet ſetled in a way of Truth and
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:124282:70"/> Peace. But my intendment ſimply was, That each particular Church when it is organized with all his Officers, and walketh in a way of Truth and Peace; There is no part of the power of the Keyes, but a particular Church hath received it within it ſelf, and may ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſter the ſame to the edification of the whole body.</p>
                  <p>Neither let it be thought (in that firſt Propoſition) That I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to inveſt a Church of Believers (without officers) with all the power of the Keyes, becauſe I ſpeak of the Election and ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of officers afterwards. For ſo I ſpeak alſo of the gathering and admiſſion of Members: and yet it may not be inferred, that I ſhould intend a Church inveſted with all power, which yet is deſtitute both of Members, and Officers. But it is a well known rule of <hi>Method,</hi> to define or deſcribe at firſt, <hi>Totum Integrale,</hi> with the proper Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncts (or Paſſions) of it, and then to deſcend to ſet forth the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Members, and integrall parts thereof, with their ſeverall ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations in due place.</p>
                  <p>So that this firſt queſtion raiſed from this firſt Propoſition is no queſtion at all; and therefore it will not be needfull to examine the diſtinctions, or concluſions raiſed up againſt it. For they do not contradict the true meaning of the Propoſition, unleſſe it be ſome parts of the ſecond concluſion, which come in their place to be conſidered of in the ſequele.</p>

                  <p>It is readily admitted what he ſaith, <q rend="margQuotes">That to be builded on a Rock, victory over hell, and ſuch like, are given principally and immediately to the Catholick, and Inviſible Church, as to the firſt and principal Subject.</q>

When <hi>Saul</hi> eſſayed to joyn himſelf to the Church at Jeruſalem, he was not received till the Brethrens fear of his carnal eſtate was removed, and themſelves ſatisfied, that he was a Diſciple; <hi>Acts.</hi> 9.26. Let no man except, <hi>Paul</hi> did not eſſay to joyn himſelf as a a member to the Church at Jeruſalem: for he was (as being an Apoſtle) an Officer, (and therefore a member) in all Churches: For his call to the Apoſtleſhip was at firſt unknown to them: and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:124282:75"/> the Argument holdeth ſo much the ſtronger, that if the Brethren muſt be ſatisfied in the Diſcipleſhip of an Apoſtle, before he can be admitted to joyn with them; much more may they require probable ground of the Diſcipleſhip of a Brother, before he be admitted to joyn with them in Church-Communion. And when the Inceſtuous Corinthian was to be caſt out of the Family of the Church; <hi>Paul</hi> referreth the Adminiſtration of that power to the joynt proceeding of the Elders and Brethren of that Church, lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to either ſort their concourſe of ſeveral power reſpectively.</p>
                  <p>Now then to apply this diſtinction of power to the Argument. All the places alledged by Mr <hi>Rutterford,</hi> do indeed prove <q rend="margQuotes">That the Keyes were promiſed and given to the Stewards and Officers, and Servants in the Houſe of God: </q>
                     <hi>which we willingly acknowledge. We acknowledge alſo that which he affirmeth,</hi>

                  <p>I ſhall not need to enlarge further anſwer to this ſecond Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. The Teſtimonies which he alledgeth to prove his Propoſition; they prove, that the Keyes ſignifie Power, and Authority, and that Stewardly, or Office-Power, is given to the Officers of the Church.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:124282:76"/>But this warrant is official Authority of binding and looſing, Chriſt giveth to Peter onely, as repreſenting Apoſtles, Teachers, and Elders: and not to a Church of Believers converted co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant-wiſe, and deſtitute of Officers, Ergo, &amp;c.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The propoſition is not alwayes univerſally ſafe, if it be underſtood of the Actuall exerciſe of the Keyes, (by them who receive them) in their own perſon. For Chriſt himſelf, who received from the Father the power of all Church Adminiſtrations: yet in the Dayes of his fleſh, He in his own perſon baptized no man: <hi>John</hi> 4.2. And after his Aſcenſion, though the Soveraign power of the Keyes do ſtill remain with him, yet he performeth all the Externall exerciſe of Church-power by his Miniſters.</p>
                  <p>If it be ſaid, that though Chriſt did not exerciſe all Church-power in his own perſon, yet he had warrant ſo to do: It may juſtly be replied, Chriſt beſt underſtood his own warrant, and he that did not exerciſe this or that Act of the Church-power in his own perſon, ſurely he did not think it expedient to exerciſe it in his own Perſon.

                  <p>But this I ſay withall, That <hi>Peter</hi> in receiving the Keyes (or the Promiſe of them) He received from Chriſt both ſorts of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate Church-Power, not only <hi>Officiariam,</hi> but <hi>Honorariam Poteſtatem.</hi> And in receiving this latter, He repreſented the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:124282:77"/> of all profeſſing Believers. For it were not reaſonable to think, that <hi>Peter</hi> receiving the Keyes as a reward of the Profeſſion of his Faith, ſhould receive no power at all to profeſſing Believers as ſuch, but all Power only to profeſſing Officers.</p>
                  <p>Ob. <q rend="margQuotes">But if profeſſing Believers, as ſuch, had received any part of the Power of the Keyes, they had then received the Power of binding and looſing, which they have not: For binding and looſing are the Acts of the Official-Power of the Keyes: <hi>Ergo,</hi> The Church of Believers being deſtitute of Officers, and Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours hath not received any part of the Power of the Keyes.</q>

                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> The proof of the aſſumption of this Argument will not hold, unleſſe binding and looſing were the <hi>Adequate</hi> Acts of the Official-Power of the Keyes. But though binding and looſing, or (which is all one) opening and ſhutting, be indeed the <hi>Adequate</hi> Acts of the Power of the Keyes; yet not ſo of their official-Power. The Lord Jeſus hath the Key of <hi>David,</hi> He bindeth and none looſeth, He looſeth and none bindeth: (<hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7.) and yet this his binding and looſing are not the Acts of the Official, but of the Soveraign power of the Keyes. The Brethren of the Church at Jeruſalem, who were ſcattered upon the perſecution that aroſe about <hi>Stephen:</hi> they preached the Word of Chriſt to Jews and Grecians about Antioch, and by the good hand of the Lord upon them, a great number believed, and turned to the Lord; <hi>Acts</hi> 11.19, 20, 21. Theſe Brethren in opening the Door of Faith to their Hearers, though they wanted Office, yet they wanted not the Power of the Keyes, to open the Kingdome of Heaven unto them.</p>
                  <p>The Brethren of the Church of Corinth concurred with their Officers, in delivering the inceſtuous perſon to Satan, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in the publike pardon of him, and releaſe of his cenſure.

And yet they neither had the official-power of the Keyes, nor did they exerciſe it. It was alſo an Act of Church Power, which the Church of Brethren at Jeruſalem did put forth in joyning in the Definitive ſentence of the Synod, and in ſending forth Letters and Meſſengers to the Churches of Antioch. Syria, and Cilicia, for the publiſhing and promulgating of the Sentence. And yet the Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren themſelves neither had office-power in themſelves, nor did they exerciſe it.</p>

                  <p>Ob. <q rend="margQuotes">But theſe Brethren in Corinth, and Jeruſalem, though they had not office-power in themſelves, yet they had it amongſt themſelves in the Apoſtles, and in the Elders then Aſſembled; And ſo with them they might joyn in ſome Act of Church-power, which without them, they might not have been put forth at all: or if they had, It had been of no power.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This were indeed to make the Church-Power in Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren a mere Cipher, yea leſſe then a Cipher. For a Cipher though it be of no number or account, unleſſe ſome Figure of the Decad be joyned before it; yet if it be joyned before it, the Cipher will increaſe the number and account, and make it at leaſt tenfold more then it was before. But all the Brethren of the Church without officers, are not onely made as ſo many Ciphers, as thoſe who of themſelves can do no Act of number or account at all: But alſo though an Officer, or a whole Presbyterie joyn with them, and go before them, yet the Act of the whole Church of Brethren, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the Act of no more account, no more value or validity, then it was before; which ſeemeth to me an unworthy thing and unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable. For ſeeing that the profeſſion of the Faith in Chriſt was the original ground, (or at leaſt the occaſion) of the grant of all Church Power unto <hi>Peter</hi> in the name of the Church, how can it ſtand either with Faith or Reaſon, That a Church of Believers profeſſing the ſame Faith with <hi>Peter,</hi> ſhall receive no part of Church-Power at all, in reſpect of their profeſſion of the Faith, but only in reſpect of their Officers that preach the Faith? whereas <hi>Peter</hi> then ſpake not as a Preacher only, but as a Profeſſor of the Faith. Faith when it ſeeth a Promiſe made to another in reſpect of this or that Qualification or Duty, It is apt (by the help of the Spirit of Grace) to apply the ſame bleſſing, or ſome part of it at leaſt, unto it ſelf in the ſame caſe.</p>
                  <p>Again, if it were ſo, that a Church of Believers deſtitute of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, ſhould have received from Chriſt no part of the power of the Keyes, then in caſe the whole Presbyt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> otherwiſe, the Church ſhould ceaſe to be a Church. For the Power of the Keyes comprehendeth the Latitude of all Church-power. And <hi>ut ſe res habet in eſſe, ſic in operari.</hi> Take away all power of Action, and operation from a Church, and you take away the Church it ſelf. And ſo you will make Miniſters to be not only the Integral parts of a Church, but the Eſſential parts alſo. Yea by this means, The eſtate of the
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:124282:78"/> Church is in worſe condition, then is the eſtate of any civil Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-wealth.

But the Church of Chriſt (which of all Societies is the moſt Honourable, and moſt completely ſupplied with Power to attain its own end, and is built upon the moſt ſure Foundation) If it be once deprived of her Officers and Rulers, it ſtraightway becometh Null, both in Eſſence and Action. Time was, when <hi>David</hi> ſpeaking to the Church ſaid, <hi>Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, thou City of God,</hi> Pſal. 87.3. And one of thoſe glorious things were, <hi>That her Foundations are in the Holy Mountains,</hi> v. 1. And <hi>the Lord loveth the Gates of Zion, more then all the dwellings of</hi> Jacob, v. 2. But ſurely, if the Churches Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, did ſo eaſily vaniſh with the loſſe of their Officers, This would turn their glory into ſhame, above all other ſocieties.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Procced we now to the fourth and laſt Argument, whereby M. <hi>Rutterford</hi> goeth about to prove, that the Church of Believers deſtitute of an Elderſhip, hath no power of the Keyes.</p>
                  <p>If the power of the Keyes lay in competition between a Church of Believers deſtitute of its own Elderſhip, and a Church of Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers furniſhed with it (as the queſtion might ſeem to import) I ſhould eaſily grant more ample power to a Church with its Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, then to a Church without it; or if the competition of the power of the Keyes lay, whether in the Church without the Elder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or in the Elderſhip without the Church, (eſpecially when the greater part of the Elderſhip conſiſteth of the Elders of other Churches) though we give not much power to a Church without an Elderſhip: yet we ſhould give leſſe to an Elderſhip without the Church.</p>
                  <p>But the true ſtate of the queſtion is, whether a Congregational Church of Believers furniſhed with Officers, and walking in the Truth and Peace of the Goſpel, have not received the power of Keyes (the power of binding and looſing) within themſelves? or, whether this power be firſt given to a Claſſical, or Provincial, or National Aſſembly of the Church Officers, or Presbyters: and from them be derived to a Congregational Church of Believers with their Officers?</p>

                  <p>But it may be alſo a ſecond queſtion touching a Congregational Church of Believers, whether no power of the Keyes (that is, no part of the power of the Keyes) be given to them without an El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſhip.</p>
                  <p>This hath M. <hi>Rutterford</hi> put for the queſtion, and maketh it the Title of every leaf of Chap. 1. Sect. 2. <q rend="margQuotes">The Church of Believers deſtitute of an Elderſhip have <hi>No Power</hi> of the Keyes.</q>

                  <p>Three of his Arguments in this queſtion we have already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſed: come we now to his fourth.</p>
                  <p>His fourth Argument then is this: <q rend="margQuotes">
                        <hi>If Chriſt do not ſay in this place</hi> (Mat. <hi>16.) nor in</hi> Mat. <hi>18.</hi> That the Keyes and the Acts of the Keyes (to wit, binding and looſing) are given to a Church of Believers without their Officers, then neither of the places prove, that the Keyes are given to ſuch a Church.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>"<hi>But Chriſt doth not ſay it:</hi> Ergo, <hi>The Text cannot bear it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. If this Text in <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. Do prove that the Keyes are given to a Church of Believers with their Officers, It is as much as I infer from it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. Yet two things there be in the words of the Text, which do infer, that ſome part of the Power of the Keyes is given to a Church of Believers without their officers.</p>
                  <p>The firſt may be collected thus; If the Key<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s be the power of edifying the Church, and the C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>urch be edified of Believers by the Publike profeſſion of their Faith, Then Believers publikely profeſſing the Faith, have ſome part of the power of the Keyes given to them.</p>
                  <p>But the Keyes are the power of edifying the Church, and the Church is edified of Believers, by the Publike Profeſſion of their Faith.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Believers Publikely profeſſing the Faith, have ſome part of the power of the Keyes given to them.</p>
                  <p>What may here juſtly be denied, I ſee not. The <hi>major</hi> Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is evident of it ſelf. For no man can do any Act of ſpiritual efficacy, but he hath received from Chriſt ſome ſpiritual Power to do it.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>habenti dabitur,</hi> to him that edifieth the Church by any power received, to him ſhall the more abundant power be given to do the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>minor</hi> Propoſition is as clear: For the Keyes are nothing elſe, but the Inſtruments of edifying the Church. Though their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:124282:79"/> and proper work be to open and ſhut (and Metaphorical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to bind and looſe:) yet both theſe are nothing elſe but Acts of edifying the Church. And that the Church is edified or builded of Believers, Publikely profeſſing their Faith: the Lord himſelf doth acknowledge in the words of the Text: when he ſaith, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this Rock,</hi> (that is, upon this Publike Profeſſion of Faith in me) <hi>I will build my Church. Peter</hi> by this publike profeſſion of his Faith, did edifie himſelf, and his fellow-Diſciples: and thereby obtained both a reward of his Profeſſion, to become the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church: and a reward to himſelf, of receiving the Keyes; that is, a power both by gift, and office to edifie the Church in a more ſetled manner, and abundant meaſure, not onely as a Believer, but as a chief Elder, and Apoſtle.</p>
                  <p>The ſecond thing in the Text, that may infer ſome part of the power of the Keyes to be given to a Church of Believers even without officers, may thus be taken up.</p>
                  <p>If <hi>Peter</hi> had the Keyes given him as a reward, not for doing an Act or Duty of his office, but for doing an Act or Duty common to him with other Believers; then Believers making the ſame publike conf<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſſion of Faith with him: As they do partake with him in the Duty, ſo do they partake alſo (in ſome meaſure) in the reward.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Peter</hi> had the Keyes given him as a reward, not for doing any Act or Duty of his Office, but for doing an Act or Duty com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon to him with other ordinary Believers.</p>
                  <p>Therefore other ordinary Believers making the ſame publike confeſſion of Faith with him, they do partake with him in the Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſo do they alſo partake in ſome meaſure in the promiſed reward of the power of the Keyes.</p>
                  <p>The former Propoſition is not onely the collection of many Divines both ancient and modern, but it dependeth upon a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal ground of the work of our miniſtry. For our Miniſtry ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it for a ſure ground of the Application of Scriptures; That what promiſe we find given to any upon occaſion of this or that qualification or condition, the ſame is intended by God, and eaſily applyed by us to all others, in whom the like condition or qualifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation is found according to their meaſure.</p>
                  <p>The latter Propoſition is ſo clear, as needs no proof, unleſſe we ſhall make the publike confeſſion of Faith in Chriſt, not to be the duty of ordinary Believers, and Church-members, but onely of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:124282:79"/> Church-officers: or unleſſe we could find ſome other occaſion, upon which Chriſt made this Gracious promiſe of the Keyes to <hi>Peter,</hi> beſide the publike confeſſion of his Faith in Chriſt befor- the Lord, and his Brethren.</p>

As the Church judgeth not of hidden crimes, ſo neither do the Faithfull judge of the Churches by their hidden hypocriſie, but by their open ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals in Doctrine, or life.

                  <p>I anſwer, Though <hi>Peters</hi> confeſſion of his faith at that time was not made for ſuch an end, for his admiſſion into the houſhold or Church of Chriſt: yet it is enough, That Chriſt rewardeth that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of his, with ſuch a promiſe of all Believers into his Church by ſuch a dore. It is true, the ſame confeſſion may be made upon other oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: but yet this appeareth to be one occaſion and uſe of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, to receive profeſt Believers into the fellowſhip of the Church, and the ordinances thereof; ſeeing we r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> into the fellowſhip of the Church, and unto Baptiſme, before they had made publike confeſſion of their faith before the Lord and his Church: Which is a thing I doubt not, well known to M. <hi>Rutterford,</hi> to no man more; that I might ſeem to do him wrong to alledge teſtimonies for it.</p>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:124282:82"/>
                  <p>Arg. 2. <hi>If Chriſt had ſpoken to</hi> Peter <hi>here of building a miniſterial Church upon his confeſſion, and gifting it with the Power of the Keys, then the Viſible Church ſhould be made as ſtable and firm from defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as the Church of elect Believers, againſt whom the gates of Hell cannot prevail. Now this is moſt untrue, ſince Viſible Churches do fall away (as the ſeven Churches in Aſia, the Church of Corinth, Epheſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>, &amp;c.) and likewiſe this would warrant the Papiſts to make uſe of this place, as they do, to prove the Invincible ſtability of the Church and their impoſſibility of Apoſtacy, &amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Though this or that Viſible Church do fall away, yet Chriſt hath ever had ſome or other Viſible Church upon the face of the earth, in one Country or other. Elſe the gates of hell had more prevailed againſt the Viſible Chriſtian Church, then ever this could do againſt the Viſible Jewiſh Synagogue.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. This or that Viſible Church that did fall away, was not a ſociety of ſuch profeſt believers as were built upon a rock; but ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ſinful generation that roſe up after them, who did degenerate from their Parents faith and Profeſſion, and ſo fell into the gulf of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacie, whether Turkiſh or Antichriſtian.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 3. Though the gates of hell have ſomtimes prevailed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this or that particular Viſible Church, holding faſt the profeſſion of their faith without wavering: yet they have not prevailed to their deſtruction, but to their diſperſion onely; which tendeth to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplication and enlargement of Particular Churches. The perſecution raiſed by the gates of hell againſt the Primitive Church at Jeruſalem about <hi>Stephen,</hi> it prevailed indeed to the diſperſion of the whole Church (ſave the Apoſtles) <hi>Acts</hi> 8.1. but that diſperſion was as ſeed ſcattered out of the garner into the field, which bringeth forth a more plentiful harveſt. And ſo did their diſperſion propagate Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es both in Samaria and Antioch.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 4. Nor will this ſtability of Viſible Churches promiſed by Chriſt, ſtrengthen the Popiſh plea of the ſtability of their Church at Rome. For it is neither that promiſe of Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. nor any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that doth promiſe ſtability to any one particular Church in this Citie or Town: nor doth any expoſition of ours, reach forth ſuch a thing. The woman may be in the wildernes, and fed by witneſſes, (the Church may be in obſcure places, and fed by faithful witneſſes) when yet neither her ſelf, nor her witneſſes dwell in Babylon.</p>
